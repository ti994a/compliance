    "# Generating Metadata Files for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases with Auto-Generated Query Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to automatically generate metadata JSON files for documents stored in Amazon S3, enabling the **auto-generated query filters** feature in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for improved retrieval accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers fully-managed, end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows to create highly accurate, low latency, secure, and custom GenAI applications by incorporating contextual information from your data sources [[1]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-auto-generated-query-filters-improved-retrieval/). This notebook focuses on preparing your documents with metadata to take advantage of the **automatically-generated query filters** capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Auto-Generated Query Filters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-generated query filters extend the existing capability of manual metadata filtering by allowing you to narrow down search results **without the need to manually construct complex filter expressions** [[1]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-auto-generated-query-filters-improved-retrieval/). This feature improves retrieval accuracy by ensuring the documents retrieved are relevant to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a query like \"How to file a claim in Washington\", the state \"Washington\" will be automatically applied as a filter to retrieve only those documents pertaining to that particular state [[1]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-auto-generated-query-filters-improved-retrieval/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metadata File Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For metadata filtering to work, you must create JSON metadata files that follow these conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The metadata file must be named `<document>.<extension>.metadata.json` [[2]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/s3-metadata.html)\n",
    "- The document's Amazon S3 key is appended to the metadata's Amazon S3 prefix and then suffixed with `.metadata.json` to form the metadata file's Amazon S3 path [[3]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/s3-metadata.html)\n",
    "- The metadata file must be a UTF-8 text file without a BOM marker [[2]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/s3-metadata.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example File Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Bucket name:\n",
    "     s3://bucketName\n",
    "Document path:\n",
    "     documents/legal\n",
    "Metadata path:\n",
    "     metadata\n",
    "File mapping:\n",
    "     s3://bucketName/documents/legal/file.txt -> \n",
    "        s3://bucketName/metadata/documents/legal/file.txt.metadata.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG applications process user queries by searching across a large set of documents. However, in many situations, you might need to retrieve documents with specific attributes or content. You can use metadata filtering to narrow down search results by specifying inclusion and exclusion criteria [[4]](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/from-concept-to-reality-navigating-the-journey-of-rag-from-proof-of-concept-to-production/). By pre-generating comprehensive metadata files, you enable the auto-generated query filters to automatically apply relevant filters based on the document's metadata without requiring manual filter construction [[1]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-auto-generated-query-filters-improved-retrieval/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regional Availability\n",
    "\n",
    "The auto-generated query filters capability is available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Zurich), and AWS GovCloud (US-West) [[1]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-auto-generated-query-filters-improved-retrieval/).\n",
