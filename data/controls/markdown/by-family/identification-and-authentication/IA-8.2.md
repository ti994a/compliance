## Control Statement
Accept only external authenticators that are NIST-compliant; and Document and maintain a list of accepted external authenticators.

## Implementation Guidance
Acceptance of only NIST-compliant external authenticators applies to organizational systems that are accessible to the public (e.g., public-facing websites). External authenticators are issued by nonfederal government entities and are compliant with [SP 800-63B](#e59c5a7c-8b1f-49ca-8de0-6ee0882180ce) . Approved external authenticators meet or exceed the minimum Federal Government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. Meeting or exceeding Federal requirements allows Federal Government relying parties to trust external authenticators in connection with an authentication transaction at a specified authenticator assurance level.

## Assessment Objectives
only external authenticators that are NIST-compliant are accepted; a list of accepted external authenticators is documented; a list of accepted external authenticators is maintained.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing user identification and authentication  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  list of third-party credentialing products, components, or services procured and implemented by organization  third-party credential verification records  evidence of third-party credentials  third-party credential authorizations  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system operations responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification and authentication capabilities  mechanisms that accept external credentials
