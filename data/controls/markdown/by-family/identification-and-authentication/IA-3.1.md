## Control Statement
Authenticate devices and/or types of devices requiring use of cryptographically based, bidirectional authentication to authenticate before establishing one or more connections are defined; before establishing local connection using bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically based.

## Implementation Guidance
A local connection is a connection with a device that communicates without the use of a network. A network connection is a connection with a device that communicates through a network. A remote connection is a connection with a device that communicates through an external network. Bidirectional authentication provides stronger protection to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk.

## Assessment Objectives
devices and/or types of devices requiring use of cryptographically based, bidirectional authentication to authenticate before establishing one or more connections are defined; are authenticated before establishing local connection using bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically based.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing device identification and authentication  system design documentation  list of devices requiring unique identification and authentication  device connection reports  system configuration settings and associated documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with operational responsibilities for device identification and authentication  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing device authentication capability  cryptographically based bidirectional authentication mechanisms
