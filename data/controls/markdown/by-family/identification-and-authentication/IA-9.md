## Control Statement
Uniquely identify and authenticate system services and applications uniquely identified and authenticated are defined; before establishing communications with devices, users, or other services or applications.

## Implementation Guidance
Services that may require identification and authentication include web applications using digital certificates or services or applications that query a database. Identification and authentication methods for system services and applications include information or code signing, provenance graphs, and electronic signatures that indicate the sources of services. Decisions regarding the validity of identification and authentication claims can be made by services separate from the services acting on those decisions. This can occur in distributed system architectures. In such situations, the identification and authentication decisions (instead of actual identifiers and authentication data) are provided to the services that need to act on those decisions.

## Assessment Objectives
system services and applications uniquely identified and authenticated are defined; are uniquely identified and authenticated before establishing communications with devices, users, or other services or applications.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  procedures addressing service identification and authentication  system security plan  system design documentation  security safeguards used to identify and authenticate system services  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system operations responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers  organizational personnel with identification and authentication responsibilities Security safeguards implementing service identification and authentication capabilities
