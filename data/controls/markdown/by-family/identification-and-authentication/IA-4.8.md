## Control Statement
Generate pairwise pseudonymous identifiers.

## Implementation Guidance
A pairwise pseudonymous identifier is an opaque unguessable subscriber identifier generated by an identity provider for use at a specific individual relying party. Generating distinct pairwise pseudonymous identifiers with no identifying information about a subscriber discourages subscriber activity tracking and profiling beyond the operational requirements established by an organization. The pairwise pseudonymous identifiers are unique to each relying party except in situations where relying parties can show a demonstrable relationship justifying an operational need for correlation, or all parties consent to being correlated in such a manner.

## Assessment Objectives
pairwise pseudonymous identifiers are generated.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing identifier management  procedures addressing account management  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with identifier management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identifier management
