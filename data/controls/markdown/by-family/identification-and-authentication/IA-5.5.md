## Control Statement
Require developers and installers of system components to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery and installation.

## Implementation Guidance
Changing authenticators prior to the delivery and installation of system components extends the requirement for organizations to change default authenticators upon system installation by requiring developers and/or installers to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system components prior to delivery and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to developers of commercial off-the-shelf information technology products. Requirements for unique authenticators can be included in acquisition documents prepared by organizations when procuring systems or system components.

## Assessment Objectives
developers and installers of system components are required to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery and installation.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  system and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing authenticator management  procedures addressing the integration of security requirements into the acquisition process  acquisition documentation  acquisition contracts for system procurements or services  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with authenticator management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security, acquisition, and contracting responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing authenticator management capability
