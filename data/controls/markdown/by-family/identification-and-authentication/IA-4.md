## Control Statement
Manage system identifiers by: Receiving authorization from personnel or roles from whom authorization must be received to assign an identifier are defined; to assign an individual, group, role, service, or device identifier; Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device; Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, service, or device; and Preventing reuse of identifiers for a time period for preventing reuse of identifiers is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. The management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames of the system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities of [AC-2](#ac-2) use account names provided by [IA-4](#ia-4) . Identifier management also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with system accounts. Preventing the reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices.

## Assessment Objectives
system identifiers are managed by receiving authorization from personnel or roles from whom authorization must be received to assign an identifier are defined; to assign to an individual, group, role, or device identifier; system identifiers are managed by selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device; system identifiers are managed by assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, service, or device; system identifiers are managed by preventing reuse of identifiers for a time period for preventing reuse of identifiers is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  procedures addressing identifier management  procedures addressing account management  system security plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of system accounts  list of identifiers generated from physical access control devices  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with identifier management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identifier management
