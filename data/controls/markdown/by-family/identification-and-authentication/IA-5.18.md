## Control Statement
Employ password managers employed for generating and managing passwords are defined; to generate and manage passwords; and Protect the passwords using controls for protecting passwords are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
For systems where static passwords are employed, it is often a challenge to ensure that the passwords are suitably complex and that the same passwords are not employed on multiple systems. A password manager is a solution to this problem as it automatically generates and stores strong and different passwords for various accounts. A potential risk of using password managers is that adversaries can target the collection of passwords generated by the password manager. Therefore, the collection of passwords requires protection including encrypting the passwords (see [IA-5(1)(d)](#ia-5.1_smt.d) ) and storing the collection offline in a token.

## Assessment Objectives
password managers employed for generating and managing passwords are defined; are employed to generate and manage passwords; the passwords are protected using controls for protecting passwords are defined;.
