## Control Statement
Manage individual identifiers dynamically in accordance with a dynamic identifier policy for managing individual identifiers is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
In contrast to conventional approaches to identification that presume static accounts for preregistered users, many distributed systems establish identifiers at runtime for entities that were previously unknown. When identifiers are established at runtime for previously unknown entities, organizations can anticipate and provision for the dynamic establishment of identifiers. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate credentials and related identifiers are essential.

## Assessment Objectives
individual identifiers are dynamically managed in accordance with a dynamic identifier policy for managing individual identifiers is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing identifier management  procedures addressing account management  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with identifier management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing dynamic identifier management
