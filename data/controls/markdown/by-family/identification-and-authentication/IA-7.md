## Control Statement
Implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines for such authentication.

## Implementation Guidance
Authentication mechanisms may be required within a cryptographic module to authenticate an operator accessing the module and to verify that the operator is authorized to assume the requested role and perform services within that role.

## Assessment Objectives
mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module are implemented that meet the requirements of applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines for such authentication.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing cryptographic module authentication  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibility for cryptographic module authentication  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing cryptographic module authentication
