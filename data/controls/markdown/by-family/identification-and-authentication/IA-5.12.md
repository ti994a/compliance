## Control Statement
For biometric-based authentication, employ mechanisms that satisfy the following biometric quality requirements biometric quality requirements for biometric-based authentication are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Unlike password-based authentication, which provides exact matches of user-input passwords to stored passwords, biometric authentication does not provide exact matches. Depending on the type of biometric and the type of collection mechanism, there is likely to be some divergence from the presented biometric and the stored biometric that serves as the basis for comparison. Matching performance is the rate at which a biometric algorithm correctly results in a match for a genuine user and rejects other users. Biometric performance requirements include the match rate, which reflects the accuracy of the biometric matching algorithm used by a system.

## Assessment Objectives
mechanisms that satisfy biometric quality requirements for biometric-based authentication are defined; are employed for biometric-based authentication.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  procedures addressing authenticator management  system security plan  system design documentation  mechanisms employing biometric-based authentication for the system  list of biometric quality requirements  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with authenticator management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing biometric-based authenticator management capability
