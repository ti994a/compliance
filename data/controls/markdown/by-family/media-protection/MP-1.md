## Control Statement
Develop, document, and disseminate to organization-defined personnel or roles: organization-level media protection policy that: Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the media protection policy and the associated media protection controls; Designate an an official to manage the media protection policy and procedures is defined; to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the media protection policy and procedures; and Review and update the current media protection: Policy the frequency with which the current media protection policy is reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require the current media protection policy reviewed and updated are defined; ; and Procedures the frequency with which the current media protection procedures are reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require media protection procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Media protection policy and procedures address the controls in the MP family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of media protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to media protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Assessment Objectives
a media protection policy is developed and documented; the media protection policy is disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the media protection policy is disseminated; media protection procedures to facilitate the implementation of the media protection policy and associated media protection controls are developed and documented; the media protection procedures are disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the media protection procedures are disseminated; the organization-level media protection policy addresses purpose; the organization-level media protection policy addresses scope; the organization-level media protection policy addresses roles; the organization-level media protection policy addresses responsibilities; the organization-level media protection policy addresses management commitment; the organization-level media protection policy addresses coordination among organizational entities; the organization-level media protection policy compliance; the media protection policy is consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; the an official to manage the media protection policy and procedures is defined; is designated to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the media protection policy and procedures. the current media protection policy is reviewed and updated the frequency with which the current media protection policy is reviewed and updated is defined;;  the current media protection policy is reviewed and updated following events that would require the current media protection policy reviewed and updated are defined;; the current media protection procedures are reviewed and updated the frequency with which the current media protection procedures are reviewed and updated is defined;;  the current media protection procedures are reviewed and updated following events that would require media protection procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.
