## Control Statement
Prohibit the use of sanitization-resistant media in organizational systems.

## Implementation Guidance
Sanitization resistance refers to how resistant media are to non-destructive sanitization techniques with respect to the capability to purge information from media. Certain types of media do not support sanitization commands, or if supported, the interfaces are not supported in a standardized way across these devices. Sanitization-resistant media includes compact flash, embedded flash on boards and devices, solid state drives, and USB removable media.

## Assessment Objectives
sanitization-resistant media is identified; the use of sanitization-resistant media in organizational systems is prohibited.

## Assessment Methods
System media protection policy  system use policy  procedures addressing media usage restrictions  rules of behavior  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system media use responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for media use  mechanisms prohibiting use of media on systems or system components
