## Control Statement
Provide incident response training to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities: Within a time period within which incident response training is provided to system users assuming an incident response role or responsibility is defined; of assuming an incident response role or responsibility or acquiring system access; When required by system changes; and frequency at which to provide incident response training to users is defined; thereafter; and Review and update incident response training content frequency at which to review and update incident response training content is defined; and following events that initiate a review of the incident response training content are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail are included in such training. For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, data collection techniques, reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes user training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and internal sources. Incident response training for users may be provided as part of [AT-2](#at-2) or [AT-3](#at-3) . Events that may precipitate an update to incident response training content include, but are not limited to, incident response plan testing or response to an actual incident (lessons learned), assessment or audit findings, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

## Assessment Objectives
incident response training is provided to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities within a time period within which incident response training is provided to system users assuming an incident response role or responsibility is defined; of assuming an incident response role or responsibility or acquiring system access; incident response training is provided to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities when required by system changes; incident response training is provided to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities frequency at which to provide incident response training to users is defined; thereafter; incident response training content is reviewed and updated frequency at which to review and update incident response training content is defined;; incident response training content is reviewed and updated following events that initiate a review of the incident response training content are defined;.
