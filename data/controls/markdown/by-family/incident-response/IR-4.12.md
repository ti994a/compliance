## Implementation Guidance
When conducted carefully in an isolated environment, analysis of malicious code and other residual artifacts of a security incident or breach can give the organization insight into adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures. It can also indicate the identity or some defining characteristics of the adversary. In addition, malicious code analysis can help the organization develop responses to future incidents.

## Assessment Objectives
malicious code remaining in the system is analyzed after the incident; other residual artifacts remaining in the system (if any) are analyzed after the incident.

## Assessment Methods
Incident response policy  procedures addressing incident handling  procedures addressing code and forensic analysis  procedures addressing incident response  incident response plan  system design documentation  malicious code protection mechanisms, tools, and techniques  results from malicious code analyses  system security plan  system audit records  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel with responsibility for malicious code protection  organizational personnel responsible for incident response/management Organizational process for incident response  organizational processes for conducting forensic analysis  tools and techniques for analysis of malicious code characteristics and behavior
