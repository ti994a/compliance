## Control Statement
Respond to information spills by: Assigning personnel or roles assigned the responsibility for responding to information spills with responsibility for responding to information spills; Identifying the specific information involved in the system contamination; Alerting personnel or roles alerted of the information spill using a method of communication not associated with the spill of the information spill using a method of communication not associated with the spill; Isolating the contaminated system or system component; Eradicating the information from the contaminated system or component; Identifying other systems or system components that may have been subsequently contaminated; and Performing the following additional actions: actions performed are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Information spillage refers to instances where information is placed on systems that are not authorized to process such information. Information spills occur when information that is thought to be a certain classification or impact level is transmitted to a system and subsequently is determined to be of a higher classification or impact level. At that point, corrective action is required. The nature of the response is based on the classification or impact level of the spilled information, the security capabilities of the system, the specific nature of the contaminated storage media, and the access authorizations of individuals with authorized access to the contaminated system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after the fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such contamination is isolated and eradicated.

## Assessment Objectives
personnel or roles assigned the responsibility for responding to information spills is/are assigned the responsibility to respond to information spills; the specific information involved in the system contamination is identified in response to information spills; personnel or roles alerted of the information spill using a method of communication not associated with the spill is/are alerted of the information spill using a method of communication not associated with the spill; the contaminated system or system component is isolated in response to information spills; the information is eradicated from the contaminated system or component in response to information spills; other systems or system components that may have been subsequently contaminated are identified in response to information spills; actions performed are defined; are performed in response to information spills.

## Assessment Methods
Incident response policy  procedures addressing information spillage  incident response plan  system security plan  records of information spillage alerts/notifications  list of personnel who should receive alerts of information spillage  list of actions to be performed regarding information spillage  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with incident response responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for information spillage response  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information spillage response actions and related communications
