## Control Statement
Analyze anomalous or suspected adversarial behavior in or related to environments or resources which may contain or may be related to anomalous or suspected adversarial behavior are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
If the organization maintains a deception environment, an analysis of behaviors in that environment, including resources targeted by the adversary and timing of the incident or event, can provide insight into adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures. External to a deception environment, the analysis of anomalous adversarial behavior (e.g., changes in system performance or usage patterns) or suspected behavior (e.g., changes in searches for the location of specific resources) can give the organization such insight.

## Assessment Objectives
anomalous or suspected adversarial behavior in or related to environments or resources which may contain or may be related to anomalous or suspected adversarial behavior are defined; are analyzed.

## Assessment Methods
Incident response policy  procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques  incident response plan  system monitoring logs or records  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  security plan  system component inventory  network diagram  system protocols documentation  list of acceptable thresholds for false positives and false negatives  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for detecting anomalous behavior
