## Control Statement
Define the breadth and depth of vulnerability scanning coverage.

## Implementation Guidance
The breadth of vulnerability scanning coverage can be expressed as a percentage of components within the system, by the particular types of systems, by the criticality of systems, or by the number of vulnerabilities to be checked. Conversely, the depth of vulnerability scanning coverage can be expressed as the level of the system design that the organization intends to monitor (e.g., component, module, subsystem, element). Organizations can determine the sufficiency of vulnerability scanning coverage with regard to its risk tolerance and other factors. Scanning tools and how the tools are configured may affect the depth and coverage. Multiple scanning tools may be needed to achieve the desired depth and coverage. [SP 800-53A](#a21aef46-7330-48a0-b2e1-c5bb8b2dd11d) provides additional information on the breadth and depth of coverage.

## Assessment Objectives
the breadth and depth of vulnerability scanning coverage are defined.

## Assessment Methods
Procedures addressing vulnerability scanning  assessment report  vulnerability scanning tools and associated configuration documentation  vulnerability scanning results  patch and vulnerability management records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning responsibilities  organizational personnel with vulnerability scan analysis responsibilities  organizational personnel with security responsibilities Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning  mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing vulnerability scanning
