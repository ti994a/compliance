## Control Statement
Assess supply chain risks associated with systems, system components, and system services to assess supply chain risks are defined; ; and Update the supply chain risk assessment the frequency at which to update the supply chain risk assessment is defined; , when there are significant changes to the relevant supply chain, or when changes to the system, environments of operation, or other conditions may necessitate a change in the supply chain.

## Implementation Guidance
Supply chain-related events include disruption, use of defective components, insertion of counterfeits, theft, malicious development practices, improper delivery practices, and insertion of malicious code. These events can have a significant impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system and its information and, therefore, can also adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The supply chain-related events may be unintentional or malicious and can occur at any point during the system life cycle. An analysis of supply chain risk can help an organization identify systems or components for which additional supply chain risk mitigations are required.

## Assessment Objectives
supply chain risks associated with systems, system components, and system services to assess supply chain risks are defined; are assessed; the supply chain risk assessment is updated the frequency at which to update the supply chain risk assessment is defined; , when there are significant changes to the relevant supply chain, or when changes to the system, environments of operation, or other conditions may necessitate a change in the supply chain.
