## Control Statement
Test backup information organization-defined frequency to verify media reliability and information integrity.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations need assurance that backup information can be reliably retrieved. Reliability pertains to the systems and system components where the backup information is stored, the operations used to retrieve the information, and the integrity of the information being retrieved. Independent and specialized tests can be used for each of the aspects of reliability. For example, decrypting and transporting (or transmitting) a random sample of backup files from the alternate storage or backup site and comparing the information to the same information at the primary processing site can provide such assurance.

## Assessment Objectives
backup information is tested frequency at which to test backup information for media reliability is defined; to verify media reliability; backup information is tested frequency at which to test backup information for information integrity is defined; to verify information integrity.

## Assessment Methods
Contingency planning policy  procedures addressing system backup  contingency plan  system backup test results  contingency plan test documentation  contingency plan test results  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system backup responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for conducting system backups  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system backups
