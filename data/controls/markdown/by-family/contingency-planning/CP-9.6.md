## Control Statement
Conduct system backup by maintaining a redundant secondary system that is not collocated with the primary system and that can be activated without loss of information or disruption to operations.

## Implementation Guidance
The effect of system backup can be achieved by maintaining a redundant secondary system that mirrors the primary system, including the replication of information. If this type of redundancy is in place and there is sufficient geographic separation between the two systems, the secondary system can also serve as the alternate processing site.

## Assessment Objectives
system backup is conducted by maintaining a redundant secondary system that is not collocated with the primary system; system backup is conducted by maintaining a redundant secondary system that can be activated without loss of information or disruption to operations.

## Assessment Methods
Contingency planning policy  procedures addressing system backup  contingency plan  system backup test results  contingency plan test results  contingency plan test documentation  redundant secondary system for system backups  location(s) of redundant secondary backup system(s)  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system backup responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibility for the redundant secondary system Organizational processes for maintaining redundant secondary systems  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system backups  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information transfer to a redundant secondary system
