## Control Statement
Employ alternative or supplemental security mechanisms are defined; for satisfying security functions are defined; when the primary means of implementing the security function is unavailable or compromised.

## Implementation Guidance
Use of alternative security mechanisms supports system resiliency, contingency planning, and continuity of operations. To ensure mission and business continuity, organizations can implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. The mechanisms may be less effective than the primary mechanisms. However, having the capability to readily employ alternative or supplemental mechanisms enhances mission and business continuity that might otherwise be adversely impacted if operations had to be curtailed until the primary means of implementing the functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort required to provide such alternative capabilities, the alternative or supplemental mechanisms are only applied to critical security capabilities provided by systems, system components, or system services. For example, an organization may issue one-time pads to senior executives, officials, and system administrators if multi-factor tokens—the standard means for achieving secure authentication— are compromised.

## Assessment Objectives
alternative or supplemental security mechanisms are defined; are employed for satisfying security functions are defined; when the primary means of implementing the security function is unavailable or compromised.

## Assessment Methods
Contingency planning policy  procedures addressing alternate security mechanisms  contingency plan  continuity of operations plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  contingency plan test records  contingency plan test results  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system operation responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities system capability implementing alternative security mechanisms
