## Control Statement
Test the contingency plan at the alternate processing site: To familiarize contingency personnel with the facility and available resources; and To evaluate the capabilities of the alternate processing site to support contingency operations.

## Implementation Guidance
Conditions at the alternate processing site may be significantly different than the conditions at the primary site. Having the opportunity to visit the alternate site and experience the actual capabilities available at the site can provide valuable information on potential vulnerabilities that could affect essential organizational mission and business functions. The on-site visit can also provide an opportunity to refine the contingency plan to address the vulnerabilities discovered during testing.

## Assessment Objectives
the contingency plan is tested at the alternate processing site to familiarize contingency personnel with the facility and available resources; the contingency plan is tested at the alternate processing site to evaluate the capabilities of the alternate processing site to support contingency operations.

## Assessment Methods
Contingency planning policy  procedures addressing contingency plan testing  contingency plan  contingency plan test documentation  contingency plan test results  alternate processing site agreements  service-level agreements  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with contingency planning and plan implementation responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for contingency plan testing  mechanisms supporting the contingency plan and/or contingency plan testing
