## Control Statement
Use a sample of backup information in the restoration of selected system functions as part of contingency plan testing.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations need assurance that system functions can be restored correctly and can support established organizational missions. To ensure that the selected system functions are thoroughly exercised during contingency plan testing, a sample of backup information is retrieved to determine whether the functions are operating as intended. Organizations can determine the sample size for the functions and backup information based on the level of assurance needed.

## Assessment Objectives
a sample of backup information in the restoration of selected system functions is used as part of contingency plan testing.

## Assessment Methods
Contingency planning policy  procedures addressing system backup  contingency plan  system backup test results  contingency plan test documentation  contingency plan test results  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system backup responsibilities  organizational personnel with contingency planning/contingency plan testing responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for conducting system backups  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system backups
