## Control Statement
Identify an alternate processing site that is sufficiently separated from the primary processing site to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.

## Implementation Guidance

Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient degree of separation between primary and alternate processing sites based on the types of threats that are of concern. For threats such as hostile attacks, the degree of separation between sites is less relevant.
