## Control Statement
Implement a tamper protection program for the system, system component, or system service.

## Implementation Guidance
Anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques provide a level of protection for systems, system components, and services against many threats, including reverse engineering, modification, and substitution. Strong identification combined with tamper resistance and/or tamper detection is essential to protecting systems and components during distribution and when in use.

## Assessment Objectives
a tamper protection program is implemented for the system, system component, or system service.

## Assessment Methods
Supply chain risk management policy and procedures  supply chain risk management plan  system and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing supply chain protection  procedures addressing tamper resistance and detection  tamper protection program documentation  tamper protection tools and techniques documentation  tamper resistance and detection tools and techniques documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with tamper protection program responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities Organizational processes for the implementation of the tamper protection program  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the tamper protection program
