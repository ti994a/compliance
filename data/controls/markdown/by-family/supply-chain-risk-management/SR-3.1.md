## Control Statement
Employ a diverse set of sources for the following system components and services: organization-defined system components and services.

## Implementation Guidance
Diversifying the supply of systems, system components, and services can reduce the probability that adversaries will successfully identify and target the supply chain and can reduce the impact of a supply chain event or compromise. Identifying multiple suppliers for replacement components can reduce the probability that the replacement component will become unavailable. Employing a diverse set of developers or logistics service providers can reduce the impact of a natural disaster or other supply chain event. Organizations consider designing the system to include diverse materials and components.

## Assessment Objectives
a diverse set of sources is employed for system components with a diverse set of sources are defined;; a diverse set of sources is employed for services with a diverse set of sources are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Supply chain risk management policy and procedures  system and services acquisition policy  planning policy  procedures addressing supply chain protection  physical inventory of critical systems and system components  inventory of critical suppliers, service providers, developers, and contracts  inventory records of critical system components  list of security safeguards ensuring an adequate supply of critical system components  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and services acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with supply chain protection responsibilities Organizational processes for defining and employing security safeguards to ensure an adequate supply of critical system components  processes to identify critical suppliers  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the security safeguards that ensure an adequate supply of critical system components
