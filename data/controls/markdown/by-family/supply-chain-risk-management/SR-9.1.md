## Control Statement
Employ anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques throughout the system development life cycle.

## Implementation Guidance
The system development life cycle includes research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal. Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for tamper resistance and detection. Organizations use obfuscation and self-checking to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for adversaries. The customization of systems and system components can make substitutions easier to detect and therefore limit damage.

## Assessment Objectives
anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques are employed throughout the system development life cycle.

## Assessment Methods
Supply chain risk management policy and procedures  supply chain risk management plan  system and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing tamper resistance and detection  tamper protection program documentation  tamper protection tools and techniques documentation  tamper resistance and detection tools (technologies) and techniques documentation  system development life cycle documentation  procedures addressing supply chain protection  system development life cycle procedures  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  inter-organizational agreements and procedures  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and services acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities  organizational personnel with SDLC responsibilities Organizational processes for employing anti-tamper technologies  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing anti-tamper technologies
