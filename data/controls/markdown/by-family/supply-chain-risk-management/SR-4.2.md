## Control Statement
Establish and maintain unique identification of the following systems and critical system components for tracking through the supply chain: systems and critical system components that require unique identification for tracking through the supply chain are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Tracking the unique identification of systems and system components during development and transport activities provides a foundational identity structure for the establishment and maintenance of provenance. For example, system components may be labeled using serial numbers or tagged using radio-frequency identification tags. Labels and tags can help provide better visibility into the provenance of a system or system component. A system or system component may have more than one unique identifier. Identification methods are sufficient to support a forensic investigation after a supply chain compromise or event.

## Assessment Objectives
the unique identification of systems and critical system components that require unique identification for tracking through the supply chain are defined; is established for tracking through the supply chain; the unique identification of systems and critical system components that require unique identification for tracking through the supply chain are defined; is maintained for tracking through the supply chain.

## Assessment Methods
Supply chain risk management policy and procedures  system and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing supply chain protection  procedures addressing the integration of information security requirements into the acquisition process  supply chain risk management plan  list of supply chain elements, processes, and actors (associated with the system, system component, or system service) requiring implementation of unique identification processes, procedures, tools, mechanisms, equipment, techniques, and/or configurations  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and services acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with supply chain protection responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibilities for establishing and retaining the unique identification of supply chain elements, processes, and actors Organizational processes for defining, establishing, and retaining unique identification for supply chain elements, processes, and actors  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the definition, establishment, and retention of unique identification for supply chain elements, processes, and actors
