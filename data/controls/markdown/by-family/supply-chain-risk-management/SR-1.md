## Control Statement
Develop, document, and disseminate to organization-defined personnel or roles: organization-level supply chain risk management policy that: Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the supply chain risk management policy and the associated supply chain risk management controls; Designate an an official to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the supply chain risk management policy and procedures is defined; to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the supply chain risk management policy and procedures; and Review and update the current supply chain risk management: Policy the frequency at which the current supply chain risk management policy is reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that require the current supply chain risk management policy reviewed and updated are defined; ; and Procedures the frequency at which the current supply chain risk management procedure is reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that require the supply chain risk management procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Supply chain risk management policy and procedures address the controls in the SR family as well as supply chain-related controls in other families that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of supply chain risk management policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to supply chain risk management policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Assessment Objectives
a supply chain risk management policy is developed and documented; the supply chain risk management policy is disseminated to personnel or roles to whom supply chain risk management policy is disseminated to; supply chain risk management procedures to facilitate the implementation of the supply chain risk management policy and the associated supply chain risk management controls are developed and documented; the supply chain risk management procedures are disseminated to personnel or roles to whom supply chain risk management procedures are disseminated to. the organization-level supply chain risk management policy addresses purpose; the organization-level supply chain risk management policy addresses scope;  organization-level supply chain risk management policy addresses roles; the organization-level supply chain risk management policy addresses responsibilities; the organization-level supply chain risk management policy addresses management commitment; the organization-level supply chain risk management policy addresses coordination among organizational entities; the organization-level supply chain risk management policy addresses compliance. the organization-level supply chain risk management policy is consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; the an official to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the supply chain risk management policy and procedures is defined; is designated to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the supply chain risk management policy and procedures; the current supply chain risk management policy is reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current supply chain risk management policy is reviewed and updated is defined;; the current supply chain risk management policy is reviewed and updated following events that require the current supply chain risk management policy reviewed and updated are defined;; the current supply chain risk management procedures are reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current supply chain risk management procedure is reviewed and updated is defined;; the current supply chain risk management procedures are reviewed and updated following events that require the supply chain risk management procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.
