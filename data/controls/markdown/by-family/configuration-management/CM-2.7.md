## Control Statement
Issue the systems or system components issued when individuals travel to high-risk areas are defined; with configurations for systems or system components issued when individuals travel to high-risk areas are defined; to individuals traveling to locations that the organization deems to be of significant risk; and Apply the following controls to the systems or components when the individuals return from travel: the controls applied when the individuals return from travel are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
When it is known that systems or system components will be in high-risk areas external to the organization, additional controls may be implemented to counter the increased threat in such areas. For example, organizations can take actions for notebook computers used by individuals departing on and returning from travel. Actions include determining the locations that are of concern, defining the required configurations for the components, ensuring that components are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying controls to the components after travel is completed. Specially configured notebook computers include computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and more stringent configuration settings. Controls applied to mobile devices upon return from travel include examining the mobile device for signs of physical tampering and purging and reimaging disk drives. Protecting information that resides on mobile devices is addressed in the [MP](#mp) (Media Protection) family.

## Assessment Objectives
the systems or system components issued when individuals travel to high-risk areas are defined; with configurations for systems or system components issued when individuals travel to high-risk areas are defined; are issued to individuals traveling to locations that the organization deems to be of significant risk; the controls applied when the individuals return from travel are defined; are applied to the systems or system components when the individuals return from travel.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  configuration management plan  procedures addressing the baseline configuration of the system  procedures addressing system component installations and upgrades  system architecture and configuration documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system component inventory  records of system baseline configuration reviews and updates  system component installations/upgrades and associated records  change control records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with configuration management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for managing baseline configurations
