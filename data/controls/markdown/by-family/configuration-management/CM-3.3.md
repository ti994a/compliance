## Control Statement
Implement changes to the current system baseline and deploy the updated baseline across the installed base using mechanisms used to automate the implementation of changes and deployment of the updated baseline across the installed base are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Automated tools can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of configuration baseline information. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities, alerting mechanisms, and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization.

## Assessment Objectives
changes to the current system baseline are implemented using mechanisms used to automate the implementation of changes and deployment of the updated baseline across the installed base are defined;; the updated baseline is deployed across the installed base using mechanisms used to automate the implementation of changes and deployment of the updated baseline across the installed base are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
