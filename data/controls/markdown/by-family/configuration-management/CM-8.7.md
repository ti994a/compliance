## Control Statement
Provide a centralized repository for the inventory of system components.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations may implement centralized system component inventories that include components from all organizational systems. Centralized repositories of component inventories provide opportunities for efficiencies in accounting for organizational hardware, software, and firmware assets. Such repositories may also help organizations rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of components that have been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions. Organizations ensure that the resulting centralized inventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability.

## Assessment Objectives
a centralized repository for the system component inventory is provided.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing system component inventory  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system security plan  system component inventory  system configuration settings and associated documentation  change control records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with component inventory management responsibilities  organizational personnel with security responsibilities   Organizational processes for managing the system component inventory  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system component inventory
