## Control Statement
Maintain the currency, completeness, accuracy, and availability of the inventory of system components using organization-defined automated mechanisms.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations maintain system inventories to the extent feasible. For example, virtual machines can be difficult to monitor because such machines are not visible to the network when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain as up-to-date, complete, and accurate an inventory as is deemed reasonable. Automated maintenance can be achieved by the implementation of [CM-2(2)](#cm-2.2) for organizations that combine system component inventory and baseline configuration activities.

## Assessment Objectives
automated mechanisms used to maintain the currency of the system component inventory are defined; are used to maintain the currency of the system component inventory; automated mechanisms used to maintain the completeness of the system component inventory are defined; are used to maintain the completeness of the system component inventory; automated mechanisms used to maintain the accuracy of the system component inventory are defined; are used to maintain the accuracy of the system component inventory; automated mechanisms used to maintain the availability of the system component inventory are defined; are used to maintain the availability of the system component inventory.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing system component inventory  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system security plan  system component inventory  change control records  system maintenance records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with component inventory management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Organizational processes for maintaining the system component inventory  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the system component inventory
