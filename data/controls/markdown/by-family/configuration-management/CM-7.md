## Control Statement
Configure the system to provide only mission-essential capabilities for the system are defined; ; and Prohibit or restrict the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services: organization-defined prohibited or restricted functions, system ports, protocols, software, and/or services.

## Implementation Guidance
Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single system component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by that single component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per component. Organizations consider removing unused or unnecessary software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies, such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services. Least functionality can also be achieved as part of the fundamental design and development of the system (see [SA-8](#sa-8), [SC-2](#sc-2) , and [SC-3](#sc-3)).

## Assessment Objectives
the system is configured to provide only mission-essential capabilities for the system are defined;; the use of functions prohibited or restricted are defined; is prohibited or restricted; the use of ports prohibited or restricted are defined; is prohibited or restricted; the use of protocols prohibited or restricted are defined; is prohibited or restricted; the use of software prohibited or restricted is defined; is prohibited or restricted; the use of services prohibited or restricted are defined; is prohibited or restricted.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing least functionality in the system  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system component inventory  common secure configuration checklists  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with security configuration management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Organizational processes prohibiting or restricting functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services  mechanisms implementing restrictions or prohibition of functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services
