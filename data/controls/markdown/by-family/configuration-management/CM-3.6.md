# CM-3.6: Cryptography Management

**Family:** Configuration Management  
**Class:** SP800-53-enhancement  
**Keywords:** Assessment, assessment plan, assurance, availability, computer security, confidentiality, control, control assessment, cybersecurity, FISMA, information security, information system, integrity, personally identifiable information, OSCAL, Open Security Controls Assessment Language, Privacy Act, privacy controls, privacy functions, privacy requirements, Risk Management Framework, security controls, security functions, security requirements, system, system security

## Control Statement
Ensure that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide the following controls are under configuration management: controls provided by cryptographic mechanisms that are under configuration management are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The controls referenced in the control enhancement refer to security and privacy controls from the control catalog. Regardless of the cryptographic mechanisms employed, processes and procedures are in place to manage those mechanisms. For example, if system components use certificates for identification and authentication, a process is implemented to address the expiration of those certificates.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms used to provide controls provided by cryptographic mechanisms that are under configuration management are defined; are under configuration management.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing system configuration change control  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system architecture and configuration documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with configuration change control responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers  members of change control board or similar Organizational processes for configuration change control  cryptographic mechanisms implementing organizational security safeguards (controls)
