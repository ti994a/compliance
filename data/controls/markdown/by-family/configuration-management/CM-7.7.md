## Control Statement
Allow execution of binary or machine-executable code only in confined physical or virtual machine environments and with the explicit approval of personnel or roles to explicitly approve execution of binary or machine-executable code when such code is: Obtained from sources with limited or no warranty; and/or Without the provision of source code.

## Implementation Guidance
Code execution in protected environments applies to all sources of binary or machine-executable code, including commercial software and firmware and open-source software.

## Assessment Objectives
the execution of binary or machine-executable code is only allowed in confined physical or virtual machine environments; the execution of binary or machine-executable code obtained from sources with limited or no warranty is only allowed with the explicit approval of personnel or roles to explicitly approve execution of binary or machine-executable code; the execution of binary or machine-executable code without the provision of source code is only allowed with the explicit approval of personnel or roles to explicitly approve execution of binary or machine-executable code.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing least functionality in the system  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list or record of binary or machine-executable code  system component inventory  common secure configuration checklists  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for approving execution of binary or machine-executable code  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with software management responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Organizational process for approving execution of binary or machine-executable code  organizational process for confining binary or machine-executable code to physical or virtual machine environments  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the confinement of binary or machine-executable code to physical or virtual machine environments
