## Control Statement
Maintain the currency, completeness, accuracy, and availability of the baseline configuration of the system using automated mechanisms for maintaining baseline configuration of the system are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Automated mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent baseline configurations for systems include configuration management tools, hardware, software, firmware inventory tools, and network management tools. Automated tools can be used at the organization level, mission and business process level, or system level on workstations, servers, notebook computers, network components, or mobile devices. Tools can be used to track version numbers on operating systems, applications, types of software installed, and current patch levels. Automation support for accuracy and currency can be satisfied by the implementation of [CM-8(2)](#cm-8.2) for organizations that combine system component inventory and baseline configuration activities.

## Assessment Objectives
the currency of the baseline configuration of the system is maintained using automated mechanisms for maintaining baseline configuration of the system are defined;; the completeness of the baseline configuration of the system is maintained using automated mechanisms for maintaining baseline configuration of the system are defined;; the accuracy of the baseline configuration of the system is maintained using automated mechanisms for maintaining baseline configuration of the system are defined;; the availability of the baseline configuration of the system is maintained using automated mechanisms for maintaining baseline configuration of the system are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing the baseline configuration of the system  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system architecture and configuration documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system component inventory  configuration change control records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with configuration management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for managing baseline configurations  automated mechanisms implementing baseline configuration maintenance
