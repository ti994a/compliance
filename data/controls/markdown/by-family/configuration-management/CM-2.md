## Control Statement
Develop, document, and maintain under configuration control, a current baseline configuration of the system; and Review and update the baseline configuration of the system: the frequency of baseline configuration review and update is defined;; When required due to the circumstances requiring baseline configuration review and update are defined; ; and When system components are installed or upgraded.

## Implementation Guidance
Baseline configurations for systems and system components include connectivity, operational, and communications aspects of systems. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to systems and include security and privacy control implementations, operational procedures, information about system components, network topology, and logical placement of components in the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational systems change over time. Baseline configurations of systems reflect the current enterprise architecture.

## Assessment Objectives
a current baseline configuration of the system is developed and documented; a current baseline configuration of the system is maintained under configuration control; the baseline configuration of the system is reviewed and updated the frequency of baseline configuration review and update is defined;; the baseline configuration of the system is reviewed and updated when required due to the circumstances requiring baseline configuration review and update are defined;; the baseline configuration of the system is reviewed and updated when system components are installed or upgraded.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing the baseline configuration of the system  configuration management plan  enterprise architecture documentation  system design documentation  system security plan  privacy plan  system architecture and configuration documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system component inventory  change control records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with configuration management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for managing baseline configurations  mechanisms supporting configuration control of the baseline configuration
