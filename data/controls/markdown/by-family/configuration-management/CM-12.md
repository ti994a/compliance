## Control Statement
Identify and document the location of information for which the location is identified and documented is defined; and the specific system components on which the information is processed and stored; Identify and document the users who have access to the system and system components where the information is processed and stored; and Document changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where the information is processed and stored.

## Implementation Guidance
Information location addresses the need to understand where information is being processed and stored. Information location includes identifying where specific information types and information reside in system components and how information is being processed so that information flow can be understood and adequate protection and policy management provided for such information and system components. The security category of the information is also a factor in determining the controls necessary to protect the information and the system component where the information resides (see [FIPS 199](#628d22a1-6a11-4784-bc59-5cd9497b5445) ). The location of the information and system components is also a factor in the architecture and design of the system (see [SA-4](#sa-4), [SA-8](#sa-8), [SA-17](#sa-17)).

## Assessment Objectives
the location of information for which the location is identified and documented is defined; is identified and documented; the specific system components on which information for which the location is identified and documented is defined; is processed are identified and documented; the specific system components on which information for which the location is identified and documented is defined; is stored are identified and documented; the users who have access to the system and system components where information for which the location is identified and documented is defined; is processed are identified and documented; the users who have access to the system and system components where information for which the location is identified and documented is defined; is stored are identified and documented; changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where information for which the location is identified and documented is defined; is processed are documented; changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where information for which the location is identified and documented is defined; is stored are documented.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing identification and documentation of information location  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system architecture documentation  PII inventory documentation  data mapping documentation  audit records  list of users with system and system component access  change control records  system component inventory  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing information location and user access to information  organizational personnel with responsibilities for operating, using, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Organizational processes governing information location  mechanisms enforcing policies and methods for governing information location
