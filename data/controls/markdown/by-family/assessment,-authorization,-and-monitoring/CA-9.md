## Control Statement
Authorize internal connections of system components or classes of components requiring internal connections to the system are defined; to the system; Document, for each internal connection, the interface characteristics, security and privacy requirements, and the nature of the information communicated; Terminate internal system connections after conditions requiring termination of internal connections are defined; ; and Review frequency at which to review the continued need for each internal connection is defined; the continued need for each internal connection.

## Implementation Guidance
Internal system connections are connections between organizational systems and separate constituent system components (i.e., connections between components that are part of the same system) including components used for system development. Intra-system connections include connections with mobile devices, notebook and desktop computers, tablets, printers, copiers, facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each internal system connection individually, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of system components with common characteristics and/or configurations, including printers, scanners, and copiers with a specified processing, transmission, and storage capability or smart phones and tablets with a specific baseline configuration. The continued need for an internal system connection is reviewed from the perspective of whether it provides support for organizational missions or business functions.

## Assessment Objectives
internal connections of system components or classes of components requiring internal connections to the system are defined; to the system are authorized; for each internal connection, the interface characteristics are documented; for each internal connection, the security requirements are documented; for each internal connection, the privacy requirements are documented; for each internal connection, the nature of the information communicated is documented; internal system connections are terminated after conditions requiring termination of internal connections are defined;; the continued need for each internal connection is reviewed frequency at which to review the continued need for each internal connection is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy  access control policy  procedures addressing system connections  system and communications protection policy  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of components or classes of components authorized as internal system connections  assessment report  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for developing, implementing, or authorizing internal system connections  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Mechanisms supporting internal system connections
