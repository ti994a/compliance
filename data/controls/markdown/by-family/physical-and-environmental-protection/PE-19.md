## Control Statement
Protect the system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations.

## Implementation Guidance
Information leakage is the intentional or unintentional release of data or information to an untrusted environment from electromagnetic signals emanations. The security categories or classifications of systems (with respect to confidentiality), organizational security policies, and risk tolerance guide the selection of controls employed to protect systems against information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations.

## Assessment Objectives
the system is protected from information leakage due to electromagnetic signal emanations.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing information leakage due to electromagnetic signal emanations  mechanisms protecting the system against electronic signal emanations  facility housing the system  records from electromagnetic signal emanation tests  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for system environmental controls  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing protection from information leakage due to electromagnetic signal emanations
