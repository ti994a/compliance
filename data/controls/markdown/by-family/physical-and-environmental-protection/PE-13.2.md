## Control Statement
Employ fire suppression systems that activate automatically and notify personnel or roles notified in the event of a fire and emergency responders notified in the event of a fire are defined; ; and Employ an automatic fire suppression capability when the facility is not staffed on a continuous basis.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations can identify specific personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have appropriate access authorizations and/or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the impact level or classification of information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.

## Assessment Objectives
fire suppression systems that activate automatically are employed; fire suppression systems that notify personnel or roles notified in the event of a fire automatically are employed; fire suppression systems that notify emergency responders notified in the event of a fire are defined; automatically are employed; an automatic fire suppression capability is employed when the facility is not staffed on a continuous basis.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing fire protection  fire suppression and detection devices/systems documentation  facility housing the system  alarm service-level agreements  test records of fire suppression and detection devices/systems  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for fire detection and suppression devices/systems  organizational personnel with responsibilities for providing automatic notifications of any activation of fire suppression devices/systems to appropriate personnel, roles, and emergency responders  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing fire suppression devices/systems  activation of fire suppression devices/systems (simulated)  automated notifications
