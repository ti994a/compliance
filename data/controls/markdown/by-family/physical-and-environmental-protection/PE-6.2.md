## Control Statement
Recognize classes or types of intrusions recognized by automated mechanisms are defined; and initiate response actions initiated by automated mechanisms when organization-defined classes or types of intrusions are recognized are defined; using automated mechanisms used to recognize classes or types of intrusions and initiate response actions (defined in [PE-06(02)_ODP](#pe-06.02_odp.02)) are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Response actions can include notifying selected organizational personnel or law enforcement personnel. Automated mechanisms implemented to initiate response actions include system alert notifications, email and text messages, and activating door locking mechanisms. Physical access monitoring can be coordinated with intrusion detection systems and system monitoring capabilities to provide integrated threat coverage for the organization.

## Assessment Objectives
classes or types of intrusions recognized by automated mechanisms are defined; are recognized; response actions initiated by automated mechanisms when organization-defined classes or types of intrusions are recognized are defined; are initiated using automated mechanisms used to recognize classes or types of intrusions and initiate response actions (defined in [PE-06(02)_ODP](#pe-06.02_odp.02)) are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing physical access monitoring  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  list of response actions to be initiated when specific classes/types of intrusions are recognized  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with physical access monitoring responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Organizational processes for monitoring physical access  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical access monitoring  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing recognition of classes/types of intrusions and initiation of a response
