## Control Statement
Employ protective measures employed against electromagnetic pulse damage are defined; against electromagnetic pulse damage for system and system components requiring protection against electromagnetic pulse damage are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is a short burst of electromagnetic energy that is spread over a range of frequencies. Such energy bursts may be natural or man-made. EMP interference may be disruptive or damaging to electronic equipment. Protective measures used to mitigate EMP risk include shielding, surge suppressors, ferro-resonant transformers, and earth grounding. EMP protection may be especially significant for systems and applications that are part of the U.S. critical infrastructure.

## Assessment Objectives
protective measures employed against electromagnetic pulse damage are defined; are employed against electromagnetic pulse damage for system and system components requiring protection against electromagnetic pulse damage are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing protective measures to mitigate EMP risk to systems and components  documentation detailing protective measures to mitigate EMP risk  list of locations where protective measures to mitigate EMP risk are implemented  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for physical and environmental protection  system developers/integrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms for mitigating EMP risk
