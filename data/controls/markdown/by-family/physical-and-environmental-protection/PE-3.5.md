## Control Statement
Employ anti-tamper technologies employed are defined; to detect physical tampering or alteration of hardware components protected from physical tampering or alteration are defined; within the system.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations can implement tamper detection and prevention at selected hardware components or implement tamper detection at some components and tamper prevention at other components. Detection and prevention activities can employ many types of anti-tamper technologies, including tamper-detection seals and anti-tamper coatings. Anti-tamper programs help to detect hardware alterations through counterfeiting and other supply chain-related risks.

## Assessment Objectives
anti-tamper technologies employed are defined; are employed to detect physical tampering or alteration of hardware components protected from physical tampering or alteration are defined; within the system.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing physical access control  list of security safeguards to detect/prevent physical tampering or alteration of system hardware components  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with physical access control responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes to detect/prevent physical tampering or alteration of system hardware components  mechanisms/security safeguards supporting and/or implementing the detection/prevention of physical tampering/alternation of system hardware components
