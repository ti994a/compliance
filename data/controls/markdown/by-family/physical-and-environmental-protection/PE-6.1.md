## Control Statement
Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides using physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.

## Implementation Guidance
Physical intrusion alarms can be employed to alert security personnel when unauthorized access to the facility is attempted. Alarm systems work in conjunction with physical barriers, physical access control systems, and security guards by triggering a response when these other forms of security have been compromised or breached. Physical intrusion alarms can include different types of sensor devices, such as motion sensors, contact sensors, and broken glass sensors. Surveillance equipment includes video cameras installed at strategic locations throughout the facility.

## Assessment Objectives
physical access to the facility where the system resides is monitored using physical intrusion alarms; physical access to the facility where the system resides is monitored using physical surveillance equipment.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing physical access monitoring  physical access logs or records  physical access monitoring records  physical access log reviews  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with physical access monitoring responsibilities  organizational personnel with incident response responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Organizational processes for monitoring physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical access monitoring  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment
