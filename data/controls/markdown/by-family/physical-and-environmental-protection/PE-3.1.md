## Control Statement
Enforce physical access authorizations to the system in addition to the physical access controls for the facility at physical spaces containing one or more components of the system are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Control of physical access to the system provides additional physical security for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components.
