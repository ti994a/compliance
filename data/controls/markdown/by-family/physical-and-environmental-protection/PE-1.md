## Control Statement
Develop, document, and disseminate to organization-defined personnel or roles: organization-level physical and environmental protection policy that: Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the physical and environmental protection policy and the associated physical and environmental protection controls; Designate an an official to manage the physical and environmental protection policy and procedures is defined; to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the physical and environmental protection policy and procedures; and Review and update the current physical and environmental protection: Policy the frequency at which the current physical and environmental protection policy is reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require the current physical and environmental protection policy reviewed and updated are defined; ; and Procedures the frequency at which the current physical and environmental protection procedures are reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require the physical and environmental protection procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Physical and environmental protection policy and procedures address the controls in the PE family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of physical and environmental protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to physical and environmental protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Assessment Objectives
a physical and environmental protection policy is developed and documented; the physical and environmental protection policy is disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the physical and environmental protection policy is disseminated; physical and environmental protection procedures to facilitate the implementation of the physical and environmental protection policy and associated physical and environmental protection controls are developed and documented; the physical and environmental protection procedures are disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the physical and environmental protection procedures are disseminated; the organization-level physical and environmental protection policy addresses purpose; the organization-level physical and environmental protection policy addresses scope; the organization-level physical and environmental protection policy addresses roles; the organization-level physical and environmental protection policy addresses responsibilities; the organization-level physical and environmental protection policy addresses management commitment; the organization-level physical and environmental protection policy addresses coordination among organizational entities; the organization-level physical and environmental protection policy addresses compliance; the organization-level physical and environmental protection policy is consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; the an official to manage the physical and environmental protection policy and procedures is defined; is designated to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the physical and environmental protection policy and procedures; the current physical and environmental protection policy is reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current physical and environmental protection policy is reviewed and updated is defined;; the current physical and environmental protection policy is reviewed and updated following events that would require the current physical and environmental protection policy reviewed and updated are defined;; the current physical and environmental protection procedures are reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current physical and environmental protection procedures are reviewed and updated is defined;; the current physical and environmental protection procedures are reviewed and updated following events that would require the physical and environmental protection procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.
