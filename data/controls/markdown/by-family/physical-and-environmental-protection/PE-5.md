## Control Statement
Control physical access to output from output devices that require physical access control to output are defined; to prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining the output.

## Implementation Guidance
Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing output devices in locked rooms or other secured areas with keypad or card reader access controls and allowing access to authorized individuals only, placing output devices in locations that can be monitored by personnel, installing monitor or screen filters, and using headphones. Examples of output devices include monitors, printers, scanners, audio devices, facsimile machines, and copiers.

## Assessment Objectives
physical access to output from output devices that require physical access control to output are defined; is controlled to prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining the output.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing access control for display medium  facility layout of system components  actual displays from system components  list of output devices and associated outputs requiring physical access controls  physical access control logs or records for areas containing output devices and related outputs  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with physical access control responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for access control to output devices  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access control to output devices
