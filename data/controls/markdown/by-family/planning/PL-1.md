## Implementation Guidance
Planning policy and procedures for the controls in the PL family implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to planning policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Assessment Objectives
a planning policy is developed and documented. the planning policy is disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the planning policy is disseminated; planning procedures to facilitate the implementation of the planning policy and associated planning controls are developed and documented; the planning procedures are disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the planning procedures are disseminated; the organization-level planning policy addresses purpose; the organization-level planning policy addresses scope; the organization-level planning policy addresses roles; the organization-level planning policy addresses responsibilities; the organization-level planning policy addresses management commitment; the organization-level planning policy addresses coordination among organizational entities; the organization-level planning policy addresses compliance; the organization-level planning policy is consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; the an official to manage the planning policy and procedures is defined; is designated to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the planning policy and procedures; the current planning policy is reviewed and updated the frequency with which the current planning policy is reviewed and updated is defined;; the current planning policy is reviewed and updated following events that would require the current planning policy reviewed and updated are defined;; the current planning procedures are reviewed and updated the frequency with which the current planning procedures are reviewed and updated is defined;; the current planning procedures are reviewed and updated following events that would require procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.
