## Control Statement
Restrict or prohibit field maintenance on systems or system components on which field maintenance is restricted or prohibited to trusted maintenance facilities are defined; to trusted maintenance facilities that are not restricted or prohibited from conducting field maintenance are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Field maintenance is the type of maintenance conducted on a system or system component after the system or component has been deployed to a specific site (i.e., operational environment). In certain instances, field maintenance (i.e., local maintenance at the site) may not be executed with the same degree of rigor or with the same quality control checks as depot maintenance. For critical systems designated as such by the organization, it may be necessary to restrict or prohibit field maintenance at the local site and require that such maintenance be conducted in trusted facilities with additional controls.

## Assessment Objectives
field maintenance on systems or system components on which field maintenance is restricted or prohibited to trusted maintenance facilities are defined; are restricted or prohibited to trusted maintenance facilities that are not restricted or prohibited from conducting field maintenance are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Maintenance policy  procedures addressing field maintenance  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  maintenance records  diagnostic records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records. Organizational personnel with system maintenance responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for managing field maintenance  mechanisms implementing, supporting, and/or managing field maintenance  mechanisms for strong authentication of field maintenance diagnostic sessions  mechanisms for terminating field maintenance sessions and network connections
