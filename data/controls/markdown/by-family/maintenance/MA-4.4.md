## Control Statement
Protect nonlocal maintenance sessions by: Employing authenticators that are replay resistant are defined; ; and Separating the maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the system by either: Physically separated communications paths; or Logically separated communications paths.

## Implementation Guidance
Communications paths can be logically separated using encryption.

## Assessment Objectives
nonlocal maintenance sessions are protected by employing authenticators that are replay resistant are defined;; nonlocal maintenance sessions are protected by separating maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the system by physically separated communication paths; or nonlocal maintenance sessions are protected by logically separated communication paths.

## Assessment Methods
Maintenance policy  procedures addressing nonlocal system maintenance  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  maintenance records  audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system maintenance responsibilities  network engineers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for protecting nonlocal maintenance sessions  mechanisms implementing replay-resistant authenticators  mechanisms implementing logically separated/encrypted communication paths
