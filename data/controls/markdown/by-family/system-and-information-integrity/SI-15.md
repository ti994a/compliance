## Control Statement
Validate information output from the following software programs and/or applications to ensure that the information is consistent with the expected content: software programs and/or applications whose information output requires validation are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Certain types of attacks, including SQL injections, produce output results that are unexpected or inconsistent with the output results that would be expected from software programs or applications. Information output filtering focuses on detecting extraneous content, preventing such extraneous content from being displayed, and then alerting monitoring tools that anomalous behavior has been discovered.

## Assessment Objectives
information output from software programs and/or applications whose information output requires validation are defined; is validated to ensure that the information is consistent with the expected content.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing information output filtering  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for validating information output  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Organizational processes for validating information output  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information output validation
