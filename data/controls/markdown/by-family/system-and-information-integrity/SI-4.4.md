## Control Statement
Determine criteria for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions for inbound and outbound communications traffic; Monitor inbound and outbound communications traffic organization-defined frequency for organization-defined unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions.

## Implementation Guidance
Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to system inbound and outbound communications traffic includes internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code or unauthorized use of legitimate code or credentials within organizational systems or propagating among system components, signaling to external systems, and the unauthorized exporting of information. Evidence of malicious code or unauthorized use of legitimate code or credentials is used to identify potentially compromised systems or system components.

## Assessment Objectives
criteria for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions for inbound communications traffic are defined; criteria for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions for outbound communications traffic are defined; inbound communications traffic is monitored the frequency at which to monitor inbound communications traffic for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions is defined; for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions that are monitored in inbound communications traffic are defined;; outbound communications traffic is monitored the frequency at which to monitor outbound communications traffic for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions is defined; for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions that are monitored in outbound communications traffic are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
