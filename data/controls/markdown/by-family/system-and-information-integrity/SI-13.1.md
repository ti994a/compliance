## Control Statement
Take system components out of service by transferring component responsibilities to substitute components no later than the fraction or percentage of mean time to failure within which to transfer the responsibilities of a system component to a substitute component is defined; of mean time to failure.

## Implementation Guidance
Transferring primary system component responsibilities to other substitute components prior to primary component failure is important to reduce the risk of degraded or debilitated mission or business functions. Making such transfers based on a percentage of mean time to failure allows organizations to be proactive based on their risk tolerance. However, the premature replacement of system components can result in the increased cost of system operations.

## Assessment Objectives
system components are taken out of service by transferring component responsibilities to substitute components no later than the fraction or percentage of mean time to failure within which to transfer the responsibilities of a system component to a substitute component is defined; of mean time to failure.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing predictable failure prevention  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for MTTF activities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with contingency planning responsibilities Organizational processes for managing MTTF  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the transfer of component responsibilities to substitute components
