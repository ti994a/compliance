## Control Statement
Employ the following tools and techniques to analyze the characteristics and behavior of malicious code: tools and techniques employed to analyze the characteristics and behavior of malicious code are defined; ; and Incorporate the results from malicious code analysis into organizational incident response and flaw remediation processes.

## Implementation Guidance
The use of malicious code analysis tools provides organizations with a more in-depth understanding of adversary tradecraft (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) and the functionality and purpose of specific instances of malicious code. Understanding the characteristics of malicious code facilitates effective organizational responses to current and future threats. Organizations can conduct malicious code analyses by employing reverse engineering techniques or by monitoring the behavior of executing code.

## Assessment Objectives
tools and techniques employed to analyze the characteristics and behavior of malicious code are defined; are employed to analyze the characteristics and behavior of malicious code; the results from malicious code analysis are incorporated into organizational incident response processes; the results from malicious code analysis are incorporated into organizational flaw remediation processes.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing malicious code protection  procedures addressing incident response  procedures addressing flaw remediation  system design documentation  malicious code protection mechanisms, tools, and techniques  system configuration settings and associated documentation  results from malicious code analyses  records of flaw remediation events resulting from malicious code analyses  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for malicious code protection  organizational personnel responsible for flaw remediation  organizational personnel responsible for incident response/management Organizational process for incident response  organizational process for flaw remediation  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing malicious code protection capabilities  tools and techniques for the analysis of malicious code characteristics and behavior
