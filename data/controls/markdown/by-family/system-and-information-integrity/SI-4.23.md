## Control Statement
Implement the following host-based monitoring mechanisms at system components where host-based monitoring is implemented are defined;: host-based monitoring mechanisms implemented on system components are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Host-based monitoring collects information about the host (or system in which it resides). System components in which host-based monitoring can be implemented include servers, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Organizations may consider employing host-based monitoring mechanisms from multiple product developers or vendors.

## Assessment Objectives
host-based monitoring mechanisms implemented on system components are defined; are implemented on system components where host-based monitoring is implemented are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques  system design documentation  host-based monitoring mechanisms  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of system components requiring host-based monitoring  system monitoring logs or records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for monitoring system hosts Organizational processes for system monitoring  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing a host-based monitoring capability
