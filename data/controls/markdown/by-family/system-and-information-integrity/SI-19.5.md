## Control Statement
Manipulate numerical data, contingency tables, and statistical findings so that no individual or organization is identifiable in the results of the analysis.

## Implementation Guidance
Many types of statistical analyses can result in the disclosure of information about individuals even if only summary information is provided. For example, if a school that publishes a monthly table with the number of minority students enrolled, reports that it has 10-19 such students in January, and subsequently reports that it has 20-29 such students in March, then it can be inferred that the student who enrolled in February was a minority.

## Assessment Objectives
numerical data is manipulated so that no individual or organization is identifiable in the results of the analysis; contingency tables are manipulated so that no individual or organization is identifiable in the results of the analysis; statistical findings are manipulated so that no individual or organization is identifiable in the results of the analysis.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  personally identifiable information processing policy  de-identification procedures  system configuration  de-identified datasets  statistical analysis report  tools for the control of statistical disclosure  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for de-identifying the dataset  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the control of statistical disclosure
