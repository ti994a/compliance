## Control Statement
Employ automated tools and mechanisms to integrate intrusion detection tools and mechanisms into access control and flow control mechanisms.

## Implementation Guidance
Using automated tools and mechanisms to integrate intrusion detection tools and mechanisms into access and flow control mechanisms facilitates a rapid response to attacks by enabling the reconfiguration of mechanisms in support of attack isolation and elimination.

## Assessment Objectives
automated tools and mechanisms are employed to integrate intrusion detection tools and mechanisms into access control mechanisms; automated tools and mechanisms are employed to integrate intrusion detection tools and mechanisms into flow control mechanisms.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  access control policy and procedures  procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques  system design documentation  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system  organizational personnel responsible for the intrusion detection system Organizational processes for intrusion detection and system monitoring  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the intrusion detection and system monitoring capability  mechanisms and tools supporting and/or implementing the access and flow control capabilities  mechanisms and tools supporting and/or implementing the integration of intrusion detection tools into the access and flow control mechanisms
