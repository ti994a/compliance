## Control Statement
Install security-relevant software and firmware updates automatically installed to system components are defined; automatically to system components requiring security-relevant software updates automatically installed are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Due to system integrity and availability concerns, organizations consider the methodology used to carry out automatic updates. Organizations balance the need to ensure that the updates are installed as soon as possible with the need to maintain configuration management and control with any mission or operational impacts that automatic updates might impose (i.e., implementing a staggered deployment strategy).

## Assessment Objectives
security-relevant software and firmware updates automatically installed to system components are defined; are installed automatically to system components requiring security-relevant software updates automatically installed are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing flaw remediation  mechanisms supporting flaw remediation and automatic software/firmware updates  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  records of recent security-relevant software and firmware updates automatically installed to system components  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for flaw remediation Mechanisms implementing automatic software/firmware updates
