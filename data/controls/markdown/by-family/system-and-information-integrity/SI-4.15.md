## Control Statement
Employ an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications traffic as the traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks.

## Implementation Guidance
Wireless networks are inherently less secure than wired networks. For example, wireless networks are more susceptible to eavesdroppers or traffic analysis than wireline networks. When wireless to wireline communications exist, the wireless network could become a port of entry into the wired network. Given the greater facility of unauthorized network access via wireless access points compared to unauthorized wired network access from within the physical boundaries of the system, additional monitoring of transitioning traffic between wireless and wired networks may be necessary to detect malicious activities. Employing intrusion detection systems to monitor wireless communications traffic helps to ensure that the traffic does not contain malicious code prior to transitioning to the wireline network.

## Assessment Objectives
an intrusion detection system is employed to monitor wireless communications traffic as the traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks.
