## Control Statement
refresh {{ insert: param, si-14.02_odp.02 }} {{ insert: param, si-14.02_odp.03 }}  ; and Delete information when no longer needed.

## Implementation Guidance
Retaining information longer than is needed makes the information a potential target for advanced adversaries searching for high value assets to compromise through unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized modification, or exfiltration. For system-related information, unnecessary retention provides advanced adversaries information that can assist in their reconnaissance and lateral movement through the system.

## Assessment Objectives
refresh {{ insert: param, si-14.02_odp.02 }} {{ insert: param, si-14.02_odp.03 }}  is performed; information is deleted when no longer needed.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing non-persistence for system components  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for ensuring that information is and remains non-persistent  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for ensuring that information is and remains non-persistent  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing component and service refreshes
