## Control Statement
Correct or delete personally identifiable information that is inaccurate or outdated, incorrectly determined regarding impact, or incorrectly de-identified using automated mechanisms used to correct or delete personally identifiable information that is inaccurate, outdated, incorrectly determined regarding impact, or incorrectly de-identified are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The use of automated mechanisms to improve data quality may inadvertently create privacy risks. Automated tools may connect to external or otherwise unrelated systems, and the matching of records between these systems may create linkages with unintended consequences. Organizations assess and document these risks in their privacy impact assessments and make determinations that are in alignment with their privacy program plans.  As data is obtained and used across the information life cycle, it is important to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally identifiable information. Automated mechanisms can augment existing data quality processes and procedures and enable an organization to better identify and manage personally identifiable information in large-scale systems. For example, automated tools can greatly improve efforts to consistently normalize data or identify malformed data. Automated tools can also be used to improve the auditing of data and detect errors that may incorrectly alter personally identifiable information or incorrectly associate such information with the wrong individual. Automated capabilities backstop processes and procedures at-scale and enable more fine-grained detection and correction of data quality errors.

## Assessment Objectives
automated mechanisms used to correct or delete personally identifiable information that is inaccurate, outdated, incorrectly determined regarding impact, or incorrectly de-identified are defined; are used to correct or delete personally identifiable information that is inaccurate, outdated, incorrectly determined regarding impact, or incorrectly de-identified.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  personally identifiable information processing policy  documentation addressing personally identifiable information quality operations  quality reports  maintenance logs  system audit records  audit findings  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for performing personally identifiable information quality inspections  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Organizational processes for personally identifiable information quality inspection  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing personally identifiable information quality operations
