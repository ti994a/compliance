## Control Statement
Implement the following controls to protect the system memory from unauthorized code execution: controls implemented to protect the system memory from unauthorized code execution are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in non-executable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited. Controls employed to protect memory include data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention controls can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware enforcement providing the greater strength of mechanism.

## Assessment Objectives
controls implemented to protect the system memory from unauthorized code execution are defined; are implemented to protect the system memory from unauthorized code execution.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing memory protection for the system  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of security safeguards protecting system memory from unauthorized code execution  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for memory protection  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing safeguards to protect the system memory from unauthorized code execution
