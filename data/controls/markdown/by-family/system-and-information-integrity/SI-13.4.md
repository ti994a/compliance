## Control Statement
If system component failures are detected: Ensure that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within time period for standby components installed is defined; ; and activate {{ insert: param, si-13.04_odp.03 }} .

## Implementation Guidance
Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to active mode can occur upon the detection of component failures.

## Assessment Objectives
the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within time period for standby components installed is defined; if system component failures are detected; activate {{ insert: param, si-13.04_odp.03 }}  are performed if system component failures are detected.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing predictable failure prevention  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of actions to be taken once system component failure is detected  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for MTTF activities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with contingency planning responsibilities Organizational processes for managing MTTF  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the transparent installation of standby components  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing alarms or system shutdown if component failures are detected
