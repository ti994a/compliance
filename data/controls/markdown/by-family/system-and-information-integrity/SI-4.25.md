## Control Statement
Provide visibility into network traffic at external and key internal system interfaces to optimize the effectiveness of monitoring devices.

## Implementation Guidance
Encrypted traffic, asymmetric routing architectures, capacity and latency limitations, and transitioning from older to newer technologies (e.g., IPv4 to IPv6 network protocol transition) may result in blind spots for organizations when analyzing network traffic. Collecting, decrypting, pre-processing, and distributing only relevant traffic to monitoring devices can streamline the efficiency and use of devices and optimize traffic analysis.

## Assessment Objectives
visibility into network traffic at external system interfaces is provided to optimize the effectiveness of monitoring devices; visibility into network traffic at key internal system interfaces is provided to optimize the effectiveness of monitoring devices.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing system monitoring  system design documentation  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system monitoring logs or records  system architecture  system audit records  network traffic reports  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for monitoring system hosts Organizational processes for system monitoring  organizational processes for the discovery, collection, distribution, and use of indicators of compromise  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing a system monitoring capability  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the discovery, collection, distribution, and use of indicators of compromise
