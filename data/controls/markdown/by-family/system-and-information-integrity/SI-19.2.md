## Control Statement
Prohibit archiving of personally identifiable information elements if those elements in a dataset will not be needed after the dataset is archived.

## Implementation Guidance
Datasets can be archived for many reasons. The envisioned purposes for the archived dataset are specified, and if personally identifiable information elements are not required, the elements are not archived. For example, social security numbers may have been collected for record linkage, but the archived dataset may include the required elements from the linked records. In this case, it is not necessary to archive the social security numbers.

## Assessment Objectives
the archiving of personally identifiable information elements is prohibited if those elements in a dataset will not be needed after the dataset is archived.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  personally identifiable information processing policy  de-identification procedures  system configuration documentation  data archiving mechanisms  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for de-identifying the dataset  organizational personnel with dataset archival responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Automated mechanisms prohibiting the archival of personally identifiable information elements
