## Control Statement
Verify that the system behaves in a predictable and documented manner when invalid inputs are received.

## Implementation Guidance
A common vulnerability in organizational systems is unpredictable behavior when invalid inputs are received. Verification of system predictability helps ensure that the system behaves as expected when invalid inputs are received. This occurs by specifying system responses that allow the system to transition to known states without adverse, unintended side effects. The invalid inputs are those related to the information inputs defined by the organization in the base control ( [SI-10](#si-10)).

## Assessment Objectives
the system behaves in a predictable manner when invalid inputs are received; the system behaves in a documented manner when invalid inputs are received.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing information input validation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for information input validation  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing predictable behavior when invalid inputs are received
