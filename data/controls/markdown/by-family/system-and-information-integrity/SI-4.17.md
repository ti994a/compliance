# SI-4.17: Integrated Situational Awareness

**Family:** System and Information Integrity

## Control Statement
Correlate information from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain activities to achieve integrated, organization-wide situational awareness.

## Implementation Guidance
Correlating monitoring information from a more diverse set of information sources helps to achieve integrated situational awareness. Integrated situational awareness from a combination of physical, cyber, and supply chain monitoring activities enhances the capability of organizations to more quickly detect sophisticated attacks and investigate the methods and techniques employed to carry out such attacks. In contrast to [SI-4(16)](#si-4.16) , which correlates the various cyber monitoring information, integrated situational awareness is intended to correlate monitoring beyond the cyber domain. Correlation of monitoring information from multiple activities may help reveal attacks on organizations that are operating across multiple attack vectors.

## Assessment Objectives
information from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain activities are correlated to achieve integrated, organization-wide situational awareness.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques  system design documentation  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  event correlation logs or records resulting from physical, cyber, and supply chain activities  system audit records  system security plan  supply chain risk management plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system  organizational personnel responsible for the intrusion detection system Organizational processes for intrusion detection and system monitoring  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion detection and system monitoring capabilities  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the correlation of information from monitoring tools
