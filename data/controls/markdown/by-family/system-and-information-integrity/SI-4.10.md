## Control Statement
Make provisions so that encrypted communications traffic made visible to system monitoring tools and mechanisms is defined; is visible to system monitoring tools and mechanisms provided access to encrypted communications traffic are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations balance the need to encrypt communications traffic to protect data confidentiality with the need to maintain visibility into such traffic from a monitoring perspective. Organizations determine whether the visibility requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic intended for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types.

## Assessment Objectives
provisions are made so that encrypted communications traffic made visible to system monitoring tools and mechanisms is defined; is visible to system monitoring tools and mechanisms provided access to encrypted communications traffic are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques  system design documentation  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system protocols  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system  organizational personnel responsible for the intrusion detection system Organizational processes for intrusion detection and system monitoring  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion detection and system monitoring capabilities  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the visibility of encrypted communications traffic to monitoring tools
