# SI-7.6: Cryptographic Protection

**Family:** System and Information Integrity  
**Class:** SP800-53-enhancement  
**Keywords:** Assessment, assessment plan, assurance, availability, computer security, confidentiality, control, control assessment, cybersecurity, FISMA, information security, information system, integrity, personally identifiable information, OSCAL, Open Security Controls Assessment Language, Privacy Act, privacy controls, privacy functions, privacy requirements, Risk Management Framework, security controls, security functions, security requirements, system, system security

## Control Statement
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information.

## Implementation Guidance
Cryptographic mechanisms used to protect integrity include digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash, and using the public key to verify the hash information. Organizations that employ cryptographic mechanisms also consider cryptographic key management solutions.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to detect unauthorized changes to software; cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to detect unauthorized changes to firmware; cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to detect unauthorized changes to information.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing software, firmware, and information integrity  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  cryptographic mechanisms and associated documentation  records of detected unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for software, firmware, and/or information integrity  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Software, firmware, and information integrity verification tools  cryptographic mechanisms implementing software, firmware, and information integrity
