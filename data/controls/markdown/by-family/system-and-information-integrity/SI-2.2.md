## Control Statement
Determine if system components have applicable security-relevant software and firmware updates installed using automated mechanisms to determine if applicable security-relevant software and firmware updates are installed on system components are defined; the frequency at which to determine if applicable security-relevant software and firmware updates are installed on system components is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Automated mechanisms can track and determine the status of known flaws for system components.

## Assessment Objectives
system components have applicable security-relevant software and firmware updates installed the frequency at which to determine if applicable security-relevant software and firmware updates are installed on system components is defined; using automated mechanisms to determine if applicable security-relevant software and firmware updates are installed on system components are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing flaw remediation  automated mechanisms supporting centralized management of flaw remediation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for flaw remediation Automated mechanisms used to determine the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation
