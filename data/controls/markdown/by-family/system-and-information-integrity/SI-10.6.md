## Control Statement
Prevent untrusted data injections.

## Implementation Guidance
Untrusted data injections may be prevented using a parameterized interface or output escaping (output encoding). Parameterized interfaces separate data from code so that injections of malicious or unintended data cannot change the semantics of commands being sent. Output escaping uses specified characters to inform the interpreter’s parser whether data is trusted. Prevention of untrusted data injections are with respect to the information inputs defined by the organization in the base control ( [SI-10](#si-10)).

## Assessment Objectives
untrusted data injections are prevented.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing information input validation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of trusted sources for information inputs  list of acceptable formats for input restrictions  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for information input validation  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Organizational processes for preventing untrusted data injections  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing injection prevention
