## Control Statement
Identify the following alternative sources of information for essential functions and services that require alternative sources of information are defined;: alternative information sources for essential functions and services are defined; ; and Use an alternative information source for the execution of essential functions or services on systems or system components that require an alternative information source for the execution of essential functions or services are defined; when the primary source of information is corrupted or unavailable.

## Implementation Guidance
Actions taken by a system service or a function are often driven by the information it receives. Corruption, fabrication, modification, or deletion of that information could impact the ability of the service function to properly carry out its intended actions. By having multiple sources of input, the service or function can continue operation if one source is corrupted or no longer available. It is possible that the alternative sources of information may be less precise or less accurate than the primary source of information. But having such sub-optimal information sources may still provide a sufficient level of quality that the essential service or function can be carried out, even in a degraded or debilitated manner.

## Assessment Objectives
alternative information sources for essential functions and services are defined; for essential functions and services that require alternative sources of information are defined; are identified; an alternative information source is used for the execution of essential functions or services on systems or system components that require an alternative information source for the execution of essential functions or services are defined; when the primary source of information is corrupted or unavailable.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  personally identifiable information processing policy  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of information sources  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  organizational personnel with systems security engineering responsibilities  system developers Automated methods and mechanisms to convert information from an analog to digital medium
