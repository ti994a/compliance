## Control Statement
Analyze outbound communications traffic at the external interfaces to the system and selected interior points within the system where communications traffic is analyzed are defined; to discover anomalies.

## Implementation Guidance
Organization-defined interior points include subnetworks and subsystems. Anomalies within organizational systems include large file transfers, long-time persistent connections, attempts to access information from unexpected locations, the use of unusual protocols and ports, the use of unmonitored network protocols (e.g., IPv6 usage during IPv4 transition), and attempted communications with suspected malicious external addresses.

## Assessment Objectives
outbound communications traffic at the external interfaces to the system is analyzed to discover anomalies; outbound communications traffic at interior points within the system where communications traffic is analyzed are defined; is analyzed to discover anomalies.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques  system design documentation  network diagram  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system monitoring logs or records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system  organizational personnel responsible for the intrusion detection system Organizational processes for intrusion detection and system monitoring  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion detection and system monitoring capabilities  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the analysis of communications traffic
