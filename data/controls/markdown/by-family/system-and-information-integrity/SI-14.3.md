## Control Statement
Establish connections to the system on demand and terminate connections after completion of a request.

## Implementation Guidance
Persistent connections to systems can provide advanced adversaries with paths to move laterally through systems and potentially position themselves closer to high value assets. Limiting the availability of such connections impedes the adversary’s ability to move freely through organizational systems.

## Assessment Objectives
connections to the system are established on demand; connections to the system are terminated after completion of a request.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing non-persistence for system components  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for limiting persistent connections  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for limiting persistent connections  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing non-persistent connectivity
