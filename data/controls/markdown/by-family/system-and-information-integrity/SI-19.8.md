## Control Statement
Perform a motivated intruder test on the de-identified dataset to determine if the identified data remains or if the de-identified data can be re-identified.

## Implementation Guidance
A motivated intruder test is a test in which an individual or group takes a data release and specified resources and attempts to re-identify one or more individuals in the de-identified dataset. Such tests specify the amount of inside knowledge, computational resources, financial resources, data, and skills that intruders possess to conduct the tests. A motivated intruder test can determine if the de-identification is insufficient. It can also be a useful diagnostic tool to assess if de-identification is likely to be sufficient. However, the test alone cannot prove that de-identification is sufficient.

## Assessment Objectives
a motivated intruder test is performed on the de-identified dataset to determine if the identified data remains or if the de-identified data can be re-identified.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  personally identifiable information processing policy  de-identification procedures  system configuration  motivated intruder test procedures  de-identified datasets  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for de-identifying the dataset  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Motivated intruder test
