## Control Statement
Check the validity of the following information inputs: information inputs to the system requiring validity checks are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs—including character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values—verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. For example, if the organization specifies that numerical values between 1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of "387," "abc," or "%K%" are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevents attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

## Assessment Objectives
the validity of the information inputs to the system requiring validity checks are defined; is checked.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  access control policy and procedures  separation of duties policy and procedures  procedures addressing information input validation  documentation for automated tools and applications to verify the validity of information  list of information inputs requiring validity checks  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for information input validation  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing validity checks on information inputs
