# AU-9.3: Cryptographic Protection

**Family:** Audit and Accountability  
**Class:** SP800-53-enhancement  
**Keywords:** Assessment, assessment plan, assurance, availability, computer security, confidentiality, control, control assessment, cybersecurity, FISMA, information security, information system, integrity, personally identifiable information, OSCAL, Open Security Controls Assessment Language, Privacy Act, privacy controls, privacy functions, privacy requirements, Risk Management Framework, security controls, security functions, security requirements, system, system security

## Control Statement
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and audit tools.

## Implementation Guidance
Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of audit information include signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography. This enables the distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and audit tools are implemented.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  system security plan  privacy plan  access control policy and procedures  procedures addressing protection of audit information  system design documentation  system hardware settings  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with audit and accountability responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Cryptographic mechanisms protecting the integrity of audit information and tools
