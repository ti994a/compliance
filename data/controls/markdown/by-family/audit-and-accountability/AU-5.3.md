## Control Statement
Enforce configurable network communications traffic volume thresholds reflecting limits on audit log storage capacity and reject network traffic above those thresholds.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations have the capability to reject or delay the processing of network communications traffic if audit logging information about such traffic is determined to exceed the storage capacity of the system audit logging function. The rejection or delay response is triggered by the established organizational traffic volume thresholds that can be adjusted based on changes to audit log storage capacity.

## Assessment Objectives
configurable network communications traffic volume thresholds reflecting limits on audit log storage capacity are enforced; network traffic is reject if network traffic volume is above configured thresholds.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  procedures addressing response to audit processing failures  system design documentation  system security plan  privacy plan  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with audit and accountability responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers
