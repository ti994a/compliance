## Control Statement
Correlate information from nontechnical sources with audit record information to enhance organization-wide situational awareness.

## Implementation Guidance
Nontechnical sources include records that document organizational policy violations related to harassment incidents and the improper use of information assets. Such information can lead to a directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity. Organizations limit access to information that is available from nontechnical sources due to its sensitive nature. Limited access minimizes the potential for inadvertent release of privacy-related information to individuals who do not have a need to know. The correlation of information from nontechnical sources with audit record information generally occurs only when individuals are suspected of being involved in an incident. Organizations obtain legal advice prior to initiating such actions.

## Assessment Objectives
information from non-technical sources is correlated with audit record information to enhance organization-wide situational awareness.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  system security plan  privacy plan  procedures addressing audit review, analysis, and reporting  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  documentation providing evidence of correlated information obtained from audit records and organization-defined non-technical sources  list of information types from non-technical sources for correlation with audit information  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis, and reporting responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Mechanisms implementing capability to correlate information from non-technical sources
