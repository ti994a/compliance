## Control Statement
Protect system preproduction environments commensurate with risk throughout the system development life cycle for the system, system component, or system service.

## Implementation Guidance
The preproduction environment includes development, test, and integration environments. The program protection planning processes established by the Department of Defense are examples of managing the preproduction environment for defense contractors. Criticality analysis and the application of controls on developers also contribute to a more secure system development environment.

## Assessment Objectives
system pre-production environments are protected commensurate with risk throughout the system development life cycle for the system, system component, or system service.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the integration of security and supply chain risk management into the system development life cycle process  system development life cycle documentation  procedures addressing program protection planning  criticality analysis results  security and supply chain risk management strategy/program documentation  system security plan  supply chain risk management plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with security and system life cycle development responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for defining and documenting the system development life cycle  organizational processes for identifying system development life cycle roles and responsibilities  organizational process for integrating security risk management into the system development life cycle  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the system development life cycle
