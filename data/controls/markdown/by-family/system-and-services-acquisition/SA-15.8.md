## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to use threat modeling and vulnerability analyses from similar systems, components, or services to inform the current development process.

## Implementation Guidance
Analysis of vulnerabilities found in similar software applications can inform potential design and implementation issues for systems under development. Similar systems or system components may exist within developer organizations. Vulnerability information is available from a variety of public and private sector sources, including the NIST National Vulnerability Database.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to use threat modeling from similar systems, components, or services to inform the current development process; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to use vulnerability analyses from similar systems, components, or services to inform the current development process.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  supply chain risk management plan  procedures addressing development process, standards, and tools  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  threat modeling and vulnerability analyses from similar systems, system components, or system services  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities
