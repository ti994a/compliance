## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.

## Implementation Guidance
Software and firmware integrity verification allows organizations to detect unauthorized changes to software and firmware components using developer-provided tools, techniques, and mechanisms. The integrity checking mechanisms can also address counterfeiting of software and firmware components. Organizations verify the integrity of software and firmware components, for example, through secure one-way hashes provided by developers. Delivered software and firmware components also include any updates to such components.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing system developer configuration management  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  system developer configuration management plan  software and firmware integrity verification records  system change authorization records  change control records  configuration management records  system security plan  supply chain risk management plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with configuration management responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities Organizational processes for monitoring developer configuration management  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the monitoring of developer configuration management
