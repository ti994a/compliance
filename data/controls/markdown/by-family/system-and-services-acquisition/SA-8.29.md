## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of repeatable and documented procedures in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of repeatable and documented procedures are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of repeatable and documented procedures states that the techniques and methods employed to construct a system component permit the same component to be completely and correctly reconstructed at a later time. Repeatable and documented procedures support the development of a component that is identical to the component created earlier, which may be in widespread use. In the case of other system artifacts (e.g., documentation and testing results), repeatability supports consistency and the ability to inspect the artifacts. Repeatable and documented procedures can be introduced at various stages within the system development life cycle and contribute to the ability to evaluate assurance claims for the system. Examples include systematic procedures for code development and review, procedures for the configuration management of development tools and system artifacts, and procedures for system delivery.

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of repeatable and documented procedures are defined; implement the security design principle of repeatable and documented procedures.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the security design principle of repeatable and documented procedures used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of repeatable and documented procedures in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of repeatable and documented procedures in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms that enforce security policies
