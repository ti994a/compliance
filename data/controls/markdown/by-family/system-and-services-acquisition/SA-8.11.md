## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of inverse modification threshold in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of inverse modification threshold are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of inverse modification threshold builds on the principle of trusted components and the principle of hierarchical trust and states that the degree of protection provided to a component is commensurate with its trustworthiness. As the trust placed in a component increases, the protection against unauthorized modification of the component also increases to the same degree. Protection from unauthorized modification can come in the form of the component’s own self-protection and innate trustworthiness, or it can come from the protections afforded to the component from other elements or attributes of the security architecture (to include protections in the environment of operation).

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of inverse modification threshold are defined; implement the security design principle of inverse modification threshold.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the security design principle of inverse modification threshold used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of inverse modification threshold in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of inverse modification threshold in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification
