## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of secure distributed composition in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of secure distributed composition are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of secure distributed composition states that the composition of distributed components that enforce the same system security policy result in a system that enforces that policy at least as well as the individual components do. Many of the design principles for secure systems deal with how components can or should interact. The need to create or enable a capability from the composition of distributed components can magnify the relevancy of these principles. In particular, the translation of security policy from a stand-alone to a distributed system or a system-of-systems can have unexpected or emergent results. Communication protocols and distributed data consistency mechanisms help to ensure consistent policy enforcement across a distributed system. To ensure a system-wide level of assurance of correct policy enforcement, the security architecture of a distributed composite system is thoroughly analyzed.

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of secure distributed composition are defined; implement the security design principle of secure distributed composition.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the security design principle of secure distributed composition used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of secure distributed composition in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of secure distributed composition in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification
