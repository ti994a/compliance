## Control Statement
Implement the privacy principle of minimization using processes that implement the privacy principle of minimization are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of minimization states that organizations should only process personally identifiable information that is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish an authorized purpose and should only maintain personally identifiable information for as long as is necessary to accomplish the purpose. Organizations have processes in place, consistent with applicable laws and policies, to implement the principle of minimization.

## Assessment Objectives
the privacy principle of minimization is implemented using processes that implement the privacy principle of minimization are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  system and services acquisition procedures  personally identifiable information processing policy  procedures addressing the minimization of personally identifiable information in system design  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  change control records  information security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers Organizational processes for applying the privacy design principle of minimization in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of sufficient documentation in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms that enforce security and privacy policy  organizational processes for managing change configuration  mechanisms supporting configuration control
