## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of predicate permission in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of predicate permission are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of predicate permission states that system designers consider requiring multiple authorized entities to provide consent before a highly critical operation or access to highly sensitive data, information, or resources is allowed to proceed. [SALTZER75](#c9495d6e-ef64-4090-8509-e58c3b9009ff) originally named predicate permission the separation of privilege. It is also equivalent to separation of duty. The division of privilege among multiple parties decreases the likelihood of abuse and provides the safeguard that no single accident, deception, or breach of trust is sufficient to enable an unrecoverable action that can lead to significantly damaging effects. The design options for such a mechanism may require simultaneous action (e.g., the firing of a nuclear weapon requires two different authorized individuals to give the correct command within a small time window) or a sequence of operations where each successive action is enabled by some prior action, but no single individual is able to enable more than one action.

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of predicate permission are defined; implement the security design principle of predicate permission.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the security design principle of predicate permission used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of predicate permission in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of predicate permission in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification
