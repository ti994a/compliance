## Control Statement
Design critical systems or system components are defined; with coordinated behavior to implement the following capabilities: capabilities implemented by systems or components are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Security resources that are distributed, located at different layers or in different system elements, or are implemented to support different aspects of trustworthiness can interact in unforeseen or incorrect ways. Adverse consequences can include cascading failures, interference, or coverage gaps. Coordination of the behavior of security resources (e.g., by ensuring that one patch is installed across all resources before making a configuration change that assumes that the patch is propagated) can avert such negative interactions.

## Assessment Objectives
critical systems or system components are defined; are designed with coordinated behavior to implement capabilities implemented by systems or components are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
