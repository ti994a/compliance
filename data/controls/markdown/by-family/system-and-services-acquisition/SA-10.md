## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to: Perform configuration management during system, component, or service design; Document, manage, and control the integrity of changes to configuration items under configuration management are defined;; Implement only organization-approved changes to the system, component, or service; Document approved changes to the system, component, or service and the potential security and privacy impacts of such changes; and Track security flaws and flaw resolution within the system, component, or service and report findings to personnel to whom security flaws and flaw resolutions within the system, component, or service are reported.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations consider the quality and completeness of configuration management activities conducted by developers as direct evidence of applying effective security controls. Controls include protecting the master copies of material used to generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware, software, and firmware from unauthorized modification or destruction. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the system, system component, or system service requires strict configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.  The configuration items that are placed under configuration management include the formal model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the current running version of the object code; tools for comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and source code with previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission and business needs of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration management support during the operations and maintenance stage of the system development life cycle.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to perform configuration management during system, component, or service design; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to document the integrity of changes to configuration items under configuration management are defined;; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to manage the integrity of changes to configuration items under configuration management are defined;; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to control the integrity of changes to configuration items under configuration management are defined;; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to implement only organization-approved changes to the system, component, or service; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to document approved changes to the system, component, or service; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to document the potential security impacts of approved changes; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to document the potential privacy impacts of approved changes; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to track security flaws within the system, component, or service; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to track security flaw resolutions within the system, component, or service; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to report findings to personnel to whom security flaws and flaw resolutions within the system, component, or service are reported.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing system developer configuration management  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  system developer configuration management plan  security flaw and flaw resolution tracking records  system change authorization records  change control records  configuration management records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with configuration management responsibilities  system developers Organizational processes for monitoring developer configuration management  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the monitoring of developer configuration management
