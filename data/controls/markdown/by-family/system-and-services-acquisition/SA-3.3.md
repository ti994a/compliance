## Control Statement
Plan for and implement a technology refresh schedule for the system throughout the system development life cycle.

## Implementation Guidance
Technology refresh planning may encompass hardware, software, firmware, processes, personnel skill sets, suppliers, service providers, and facilities. The use of obsolete or nearing obsolete technology may increase the security and privacy risks associated with unsupported components, counterfeit or repurposed components, components unable to implement security or privacy requirements, slow or inoperable components, components from untrusted sources, inadvertent personnel error, or increased complexity. Technology refreshes typically occur during the operations and maintenance stage of the system development life cycle.

## Assessment Objectives
a technology refresh schedule is planned for the system throughout the system development life cycle; a technology refresh schedule is implemented for the system throughout the system development life cycle.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  system and services acquisition procedures  procedures addressing technology refresh planning and implementation  system development life cycle documentation  technology refresh schedule  security risk assessment documentation  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  organizational personnel with system life cycle development responsibilities Organizational processes for defining and documenting the system development life cycle  organizational processes for identifying system development life cycle roles and responsibilities  organizational processes for integrating security and privacy risk management into the system development life cycle  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the system development life cycle
