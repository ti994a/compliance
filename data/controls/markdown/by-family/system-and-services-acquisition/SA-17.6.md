## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to structure security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to facilitate testing.

## Implementation Guidance
Applying the security design principles in [SP 800-160-1](#e3cc0520-a366-4fc9-abc2-5272db7e3564) promotes complete, consistent, and comprehensive testing and evaluation of systems, system components, and services. The thoroughness of such testing contributes to the evidence produced to generate an effective assurance case or argument as to the trustworthiness of the system, system component, or service.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to structure security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to facilitate testing.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  enterprise architecture policy  procedures addressing developer security architecture and design specifications for the system  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  system design documentation  system security architecture documentation  privacy architecture documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  developer documentation describing the design and structure of security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware components to facilitate testing  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with information security and privacy architecture and design responsibilities
