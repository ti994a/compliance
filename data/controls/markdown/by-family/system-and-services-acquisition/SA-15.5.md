## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to reduce attack surfaces to thresholds to which attack surfaces are reduced are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with threat and vulnerability analyses and system architecture and design. Attack surface reduction is a means of reducing risk to organizations by giving attackers less opportunity to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., potential vulnerabilities) within systems, system components, and system services. Attack surface reduction includes implementing the concept of layered defenses, applying the principles of least privilege and least functionality, applying secure software development practices, deprecating unsafe functions, reducing entry points available to unauthorized users, reducing the amount of code that executes, and eliminating application programming interfaces (APIs) that are vulnerable to attacks.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to reduce attack surfaces to thresholds to which attack surfaces are reduced are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing development process, standards, and tools  procedures addressing attack surface reduction  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system or system service  system design documentation  network diagram  system configuration settings and associated documentation establishing/enforcing organization-defined thresholds for reducing attack surfaces  list of restricted ports, protocols, functions, and services  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel responsible for attack surface reduction thresholds  system developer Organizational processes for defining attack surface reduction thresholds
