## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to: Produce, as an integral part of the development process, an informal descriptive top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and effects; Show via informal demonstration, convincing argument with formal methods as feasible that the descriptive top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model; Show via informal demonstration, that the descriptive top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; Show that the descriptive top-level specification is an accurate description of the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the descriptive top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.

## Implementation Guidance
Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation of the model, and that additional code or implementation detail has no impact on the behaviors or policies being modeled. Consistency between the descriptive top-level specification (i.e., high-level/low-level design) and the formal policy model is generally not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a combination of formal and informal methods may be needed to show such consistency. Hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware include mapping registers and direct memory input and output.

## Assessment Objectives
as an integral part of the development process, the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce an informal, descriptive top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions; as an integral part of the development process, the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce an informal, descriptive top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of error messages; as an integral part of the development process, the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce an informal, descriptive top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of effects; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to show via informal demonstration, convincing argument with formal methods as feasible that the descriptive top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to show via informal demonstration that the descriptive top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to show that the descriptive top-level specification is an accurate description of the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms that are not addressed in the descriptive top-level specification but are strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  enterprise architecture policy  formal policy model  procedures addressing developer security architecture and design specifications for the system  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  informal, descriptive top-level specification documentation  system security architecture and design documentation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  documentation describing security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the informal, descriptive top-level specification documentation  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with information security architecture and design responsibilities
