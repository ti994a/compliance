## Control Statement
Approve, document, and control the use of live data in preproduction environments for the system, system component, or system service; and Protect preproduction environments for the system, system component, or system service at the same impact or classification level as any live data in use within the preproduction environments.

## Implementation Guidance
Live data is also referred to as operational data. The use of live or operational data in preproduction (i.e., development, test, and integration) environments can result in significant risks to organizations. In addition, the use of personally identifiable information in testing, research, and training increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of such information. Therefore, it is important for the organization to manage any additional risks that may result from the use of live or operational data. Organizations can minimize such risks by using test or dummy data during the design, development, and testing of systems, system components, and system services. Risk assessment techniques may be used to determine if the risk of using live or operational data is acceptable.

## Assessment Objectives
the use of live data in pre-production environments is approved for the system, system component, or system service; the use of live data in pre-production environments is documented for the system, system component, or system service; the use of live data in pre-production environments is controlled for the system, system component, or system service; pre-production environments for the system, system component, or system service are protected at the same impact or classification level as any live data in use within the pre-production environments.
