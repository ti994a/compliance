## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of self-reliant trustworthiness in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of self-reliant trustworthiness are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of self-reliant trustworthiness states that systems minimize their reliance on other systems for their own trustworthiness. A system is trustworthy by default, and any connection to an external entity is used to supplement its function. If a system were required to maintain a connection with another external entity in order to maintain its trustworthiness, then that system would be vulnerable to malicious and non-malicious threats that could result in the loss or degradation of that connection. The benefit of the principle of self-reliant trustworthiness is that the isolation of a system will make it less vulnerable to attack. A corollary to this principle relates to the ability of the system (or system component) to operate in isolation and then resynchronize with other components when it is rejoined with them.

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of self-reliant trustworthiness are defined; implement the security design principle of self-reliant trustworthiness.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the security design principle of self-reliant trustworthiness used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of self-reliant trustworthiness in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of self-reliant trustworthiness in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification
