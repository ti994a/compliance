## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of efficiently mediated access in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of efficiently mediated access are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of efficiently mediated access states that policy enforcement mechanisms utilize the least common mechanism available while satisfying stakeholder requirements within expressed constraints. The mediation of access to system resources (i.e., CPU, memory, devices, communication ports, services, infrastructure, data, and information) is often the predominant security function of secure systems. It also enables the realization of protections for the capability provided to stakeholders by the system. Mediation of resource access can result in performance bottlenecks if the system is not designed correctly. For example, by using hardware mechanisms, efficiently mediated access can be achieved. Once access to a low-level resource such as memory has been obtained, hardware protection mechanisms can ensure that out-of-bounds access does not occur.

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of efficiently mediated access are defined; implement the security design principle of efficiently mediated access.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the security design principle of efficiently mediated access used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting responsibilities  organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of efficiently mediated access in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of efficiently mediated access in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification
