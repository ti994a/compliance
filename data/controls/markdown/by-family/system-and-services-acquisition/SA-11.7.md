## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to verify that the scope of testing and evaluation provides complete coverage of the required controls at the following level of rigor: organization-defined breadth and depth of testing and evaluation.

## Implementation Guidance
Verifying that testing and evaluation provides complete coverage of required controls can be accomplished by a variety of analytic techniques ranging from informal to formal. Each of these techniques provides an increasing level of assurance that corresponds to the degree of formality of the analysis. Rigorously demonstrating control coverage at the highest levels of assurance can be achieved using formal modeling and analysis techniques, including correlation between control implementation and corresponding test cases.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to verify that the scope of testing and evaluation provides complete coverage of the required controls at the breadth of testing and evaluation of required controls is defined;; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to verify that the scope of testing and evaluation provides complete coverage of the required controls at the depth of testing and evaluation of required controls is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing system developer security testing  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  system developer security testing and evaluation plans  system developer security testing and evaluation results  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with developer security testing responsibilities  system developers  independent verification agent Organizational processes for monitoring developer security testing and evaluation  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the monitoring of developer security testing and evaluation
