## Control Statement
Maintain exclusive control of cryptographic keys for encrypted material stored or transmitted through an external system.

## Implementation Guidance
Maintaining exclusive control of cryptographic keys in an external system prevents decryption of organizational data by external system staff. Organizational control of cryptographic keys can be implemented by encrypting and decrypting data inside the organization as data is sent to and received from the external system or by employing a component that permits encryption and decryption functions to be local to the external system but allows exclusive organizational access to the encryption keys.

## Assessment Objectives
exclusive control of cryptographic keys is maintained for encrypted material stored or transmitted through an external system.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing external system services  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  procedures addressing organization-controlled cryptographic key management  organizational security requirements or conditions for external providers  system security plan  supply chain risk management plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organization personnel with cryptographic key management responsibilities  external providers of system services  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities Organizational processes for cryptographic key management  mechanisms for supporting and implementing the management of organization-controlled cryptographic keys
