## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system or system component to minimize the use of personally identifiable information in development and test environments.

## Implementation Guidance
In support of better incident response and the ability to more quickly reconstruct security-related actions, identifying specific requirements for secure logging facilitates the ability to connect application-produced audit event logs with operational data. Event types are consistent with the event types defined in [AU-02](#au-2).

## Assessment Objectives
Determine if:  the developer of the system, system component, or system service uses secure logging format(s) are defined; to log events types to log are defined; at level of detail to log is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy;   solicitation documentation;   acquisition documentation;   service level agreements;   acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service;   requirements for logging format, event types, and level of detail;  documentation evidence of requirements for logging format, event types, and level of detail;  system security plan; other relevant documents or records. Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities;   organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;   system developer Developer logs for the system, system component, or system service.
