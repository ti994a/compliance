## Control Statement
Develop, document, and disseminate to organization-defined personnel or roles: organization-level personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy that: Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and the associated personally identifiable information processing and transparency controls; Designate an an official to manage the personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures is defined; to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures; and Review and update the current personally identifiable information processing and transparency: Policy the frequency at which the current personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy is reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require the current personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy reviewed and updated are defined; ; and Procedures the frequency at which the current personally identifiable information processing and transparency procedures are reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require the personally identifiable information processing and transparency procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures address the controls in the PT family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Assessment Objectives
a personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy is developed and documented; the personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy is disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy is disseminated; personally identifiable information processing and transparency procedures to facilitate the implementation of the personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and associated personally identifiable information processing and transparency controls are developed and documented; the personally identifiable information processing and transparency procedures are disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the personally identifiable information processing and transparency procedures are disseminated; the organization-level personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy addresses purpose; the organization-level personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy addresses scope; the organization-level personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy addresses roles; the organization-level personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy addresses responsibilities; the organization-level personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy addresses management commitment; the organization-level personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy addresses coordination among organizational entities; the organization-level personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy addresses compliance; the organization-level personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy is consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; the an official to manage the personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures is defined; is designated to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures; the current personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy is reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy is reviewed and updated is defined;; the current personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy is reviewed and updated following events that would require the current personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy reviewed and updated are defined;; the current personally identifiable information processing and transparency procedures are reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current personally identifiable information processing and transparency procedures are reviewed and updated is defined;; the current personally identifiable information processing and transparency procedures are reviewed and updated following events that would require the personally identifiable information processing and transparency procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.
