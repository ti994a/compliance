## Control Statement
When a system or organization processes information for the purpose of conducting a matching program: Obtain approval from the Data Integrity Board to conduct the matching program; Develop and enter into a computer matching agreement; Publish a matching notice in the Federal Register; Independently verify the information produced by the matching program before taking adverse action against an individual, if required; and Provide individuals with notice and an opportunity to contest the findings before taking adverse action against an individual.

## Implementation Guidance
The [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) establishes requirements for federal and non-federal agencies if they engage in a matching program. In general, a matching program is a computerized comparison of records from two or more automated [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) systems of records or an automated system of records and automated records maintained by a non-federal agency (or agent thereof). A matching program either pertains to federal benefit programs or federal personnel or payroll records. A federal benefit match is performed to determine or verify eligibility for payments under federal benefit programs or to recoup payments or delinquent debts under federal benefit programs. A matching program involves not just the matching activity itself but also the investigative follow-up and ultimate action, if any.

## Assessment Objectives
approval to conduct the matching program is obtained from the Data Integrity Board when a system or organization processes information for the purpose of conducting a matching program; a computer matching agreement is developed when a system or organization processes information for the purpose of conducting a matching program; a computer matching agreement is entered into when a system or organization processes information for the purpose of conducting a matching program; a matching notice is published in the Federal Register when a system or organization processes information for the purpose of conducting a matching program; the information produced by the matching program is independently verified before taking adverse action against an individual, if required, when a system or organization processes information for the purpose of conducting a matching program; individuals are provided with notice when a system or organization processes information for the purpose of conducting a matching program; individuals are provided with an opportunity to contest the findings before adverse action is taken against them when a system or organization processes information for the purpose of conducting a matching program.
