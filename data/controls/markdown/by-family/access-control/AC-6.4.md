## Control Statement
Provide separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation of user privileges.

## Implementation Guidance
Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of user privileges includes using virtualization techniques to permit additional user privileges within a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to the underlying physical machine, implementing separate physical domains, and employing hardware or software domain separation mechanisms.

## Assessment Objectives
separate processing domains are provided to enable finer-grain allocation of user privileges.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing least privilege  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing least privilege functions
