## Control Statement
establish {{ insert: param, ac-20_odp.02 }}  , consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to: Access the system from external systems; and Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems; or Prohibit the use of types of external systems prohibited from use are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems, and for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and systems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).  For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.  External systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope of [AC-20](#ac-20) . Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and conditions address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the terms and conditions with the owners of the external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.

## Assessment Objectives
establish {{ insert: param, ac-20_odp.02 }}  is/are consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to access the system from external systems (if applicable); establish {{ insert: param, ac-20_odp.02 }}  is/are consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems (if applicable); the use of types of external systems prohibited from use are defined; is prohibited (if applicable).

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing the use of external systems  external systems terms and conditions  list of types of applications accessible from external systems  maximum security categorization for information processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining terms and conditions for use of external systems to access organizational systems  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on the use of external systems
