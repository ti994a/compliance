## Control Statement
Enforce one-way information flows through hardware-based flow control mechanisms.

## Implementation Guidance
One-way flow mechanisms may also be referred to as a unidirectional network, unidirectional security gateway, or data diode. One-way flow mechanisms can be used to prevent data from being exported from a higher impact or classified domain or system while permitting data from a lower impact or unclassified domain or system to be imported.

## Assessment Objectives
one-way information flows are enforced through hardware-based flow control mechanisms.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  information flow control policies  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system hardware mechanisms and associated configurations  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Hardware mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy
