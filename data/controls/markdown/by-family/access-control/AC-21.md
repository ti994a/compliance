## Control Statement
Enable authorized users to determine whether access authorizations assigned to a sharing partner match the information’s access and use restrictions for information-sharing circumstances where user discretion is required to determine whether access authorizations assigned to a sharing partner match the information’s access and use restrictions are defined; ; and Employ automated mechanisms or manual processes that assist users in making information-sharing and collaboration decisions are defined; to assist users in making information sharing and collaboration decisions.

## Implementation Guidance
Information sharing applies to information that may be restricted in some manner based on some formal or administrative determination. Examples of such information include, contract-sensitive information, classified information related to special access programs or compartments, privileged information, proprietary information, and personally identifiable information. Security and privacy risk assessments as well as applicable laws, regulations, and policies can provide useful inputs to these determinations. Depending on the circumstances, sharing partners may be defined at the individual, group, or organizational level. Information may be defined by content, type, security category, or special access program or compartment. Access restrictions may include non-disclosure agreements (NDA). Information flow techniques and security attributes may be used to provide automated assistance to users making sharing and collaboration decisions.

## Assessment Objectives
authorized users are enabled to determine whether access authorizations assigned to a sharing partner match the information’s access and use restrictions for information-sharing circumstances where user discretion is required to determine whether access authorizations assigned to a sharing partner match the information’s access and use restrictions are defined;; automated mechanisms or manual processes that assist users in making information-sharing and collaboration decisions are defined; are employed to assist users in making information-sharing and collaboration decisions.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing user-based collaboration and information sharing (including restrictions)  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of users authorized to make information-sharing/collaboration decisions  list of information-sharing circumstances requiring user discretion  non-disclosure agreements  acquisitions/contractual agreements  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  security and privacy risk assessments  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for information-sharing/collaboration decisions  organizational personnel with responsibility for acquisitions/contractual agreements  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Automated mechanisms or manual process implementing access authorizations supporting information-sharing/user collaboration decisions
