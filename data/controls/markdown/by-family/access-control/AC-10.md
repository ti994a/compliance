## Control Statement
Limit the number of concurrent sessions for each accounts and/or account types for which to limit the number of concurrent sessions is defined; to the number of concurrent sessions allowed for each account and/or account type is defined;.

Organizations may define the maximum number of concurrent sessions for system accounts globally, by account type, by account, or any combination thereof. For example, organizations may limit the number of concurrent sessions for system administrators or other individuals working in particularly sensitive domains or mission-critical applications. Concurrent session control addresses concurrent sessions for system accounts. It does not, however, address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts.

## Assessment Objectives
the number of concurrent sessions for each accounts and/or account types for which to limit the number of concurrent sessions is defined; is limited to the number of concurrent sessions allowed for each account and/or account type is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing concurrent session control  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  security plan  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing access control policy for concurrent session control
