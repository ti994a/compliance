## Control Statement
When transferring information between different security domains, implement content filtering solutions that provide redundant and independent filtering mechanisms for each data type.

## Implementation Guidance
Content filtering is the process of inspecting information as it traverses a cross-domain solution and determines if the information meets a predefined policy. Redundant and independent content filtering eliminates a single point of failure filtering system. Independence is defined as the implementation of a content filter that uses a different code base and supporting libraries (e.g., two JPEG filters using different vendors’ JPEG libraries) and multiple, independent system processes.

## Assessment Objectives
when transferring information between security domains, implemented content filtering solutions provide redundant and independent filtering mechanisms for each data type.

## Assessment Methods
Information flow enforcement policy  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information flow enforcement responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement functions
