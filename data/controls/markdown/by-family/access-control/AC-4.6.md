## Control Statement
Enforce information flow control based on metadata on which to base enforcement of information flow control is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Metadata is information that describes the characteristics of data. Metadata can include structural metadata describing data structures or descriptive metadata describing data content. Enforcement of allowed information flows based on metadata enables simpler and more effective flow control. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of metadata regarding data accuracy (i.e., knowledge that the metadata values are correct with respect to the data), data integrity (i.e., protecting against unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the binding of metadata to the data payload (i.e., employing sufficiently strong binding techniques with appropriate assurance).

## Assessment Objectives
information flow control enforcement is based on metadata on which to base enforcement of information flow control is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  information flow control policies  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  types of metadata used to enforce information flow control decisions  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy
