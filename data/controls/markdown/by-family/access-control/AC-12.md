## Control Statement
Automatically terminate a user session after conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions (in contrast to [SC-10](#sc-10) , which addresses the termination of network connections associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect)). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational system. Such user sessions can be terminated without terminating network sessions. Session termination ends all processes associated with a user’s logical session except for those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events that require automatic termination of the session include organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, or time-of-day restrictions on system use.

## Assessment Objectives
a user session is automatically terminated after conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing session termination  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Automated mechanisms implementing user session termination
