## Control Statement
Restrict the use of non-organizationally owned systems or system components to process, store, or transmit organizational information using restrictions on the use of non-organizationally owned systems or system components to process, store, or transmit organizational information are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Non-organizationally owned systems or system components include systems or system components owned by other organizations as well as personally owned devices. There are potential risks to using non-organizationally owned systems or components. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit such use (see [AC-20 b.](#ac-20_smt.b) ). In other cases, the use of such systems or system components may be allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions include requiring the implementation of approved controls prior to authorizing the connection of non-organizationally owned systems and components; limiting access to types of information, services, or applications; using virtualization techniques to limit processing and storage activities to servers or system components provisioned by the organization; and agreeing to the terms and conditions for usage. Organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using personally owned devices, including requirements for conducting forensic analyses during investigations after an incident.

## Assessment Objectives
the use of non-organizationally owned systems or system components to process, store, or transmit organizational information is restricted using restrictions on the use of non-organizationally owned systems or system components to process, store, or transmit organizational information are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing the use of external systems  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system connection or processing agreements  account management documents  system audit records, other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for restricting or prohibiting the use of non-organizationally owned systems, system components, or devices  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing restrictions on the use of non-organizationally owned systems, components, or devices
