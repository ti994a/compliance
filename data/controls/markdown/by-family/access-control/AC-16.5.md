## Control Statement
Display security and privacy attributes in human-readable form on each object that the system transmits to output devices to identify special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions used for each object that the system transmits to output devices are defined; using human-readable, standard naming conventions for the security and privacy attributes displayed in human-readable form on each object that the system transmits to output devices are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
System outputs include printed pages, screens, or equivalent items. System output devices include printers, notebook computers, video displays, smart phones, and tablets. To mitigate the risk of unauthorized exposure of information (e.g., shoulder surfing), the outputs display full attribute values when unmasked by the subscriber.

## Assessment Objectives
security attributes are displayed in human-readable form on each object that the system transmits to output devices to identify special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions used for each object that the system transmits to output devices are defined; using human-readable, standard naming conventions for the security and privacy attributes displayed in human-readable form on each object that the system transmits to output devices are defined;; privacy attributes are displayed in human-readable form on each object that the system transmits to output devices to identify special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions used for each object that the system transmits to output devices are defined; using human-readable, standard naming conventions for the security and privacy attributes displayed in human-readable form on each object that the system transmits to output devices are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing display of security and privacy attributes in human-readable form  special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions  types of human-readable, standard naming conventions  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system developers System output devices displaying security and privacy attributes in human-readable form on each object
