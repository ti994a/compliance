## Control Statement
Transmit access authorization information transmitted to systems that enforce access control decisions is defined; using controls used when authorization information is transmitted to systems that enforce access control decisions are defined; to systems that enforce access control decisions are defined; that enforce access control decisions.

## Implementation Guidance
Authorization processes and access control decisions may occur in separate parts of systems or in separate systems. In such instances, authorization information is transmitted securely (e.g., using cryptographic mechanisms) so that timely access control decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations. To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit as part of the access authorization information supporting security and privacy attributes. This is because in distributed systems, there are various access control decisions that need to be made, and different entities make these decisions in a serial fashion, each requiring those attributes to make the decisions. Protecting access authorization information ensures that such information cannot be altered, spoofed, or compromised during transmission.

## Assessment Objectives
access authorization information transmitted to systems that enforce access control decisions is defined; is transmitted using controls used when authorization information is transmitted to systems that enforce access control decisions are defined; to systems that enforce access control decisions are defined; that enforce access control decisions.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing access enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with access enforcement responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing access enforcement functions
