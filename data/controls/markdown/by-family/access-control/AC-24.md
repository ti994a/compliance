## Control Statement
establish procedures to ensure access control decisions applied to each access request prior to access enforcement are defined; are applied to each access request prior to access enforcement.

## Implementation Guidance
Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions) occur when authorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast, access enforcement occurs when systems enforce access control decisions. While it is common to have access control decisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not required, and it is not always an optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and distributed systems, different entities may make access control decisions and enforce access.

## Assessment Objectives
establish procedures are taken to ensure that access control decisions applied to each access request prior to access enforcement are defined; are applied to each access request prior to access enforcement.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing access control decisions  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for establishing procedures regarding access control decisions to the system  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms applying established access control decisions and procedures
