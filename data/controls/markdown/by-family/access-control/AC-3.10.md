Override conditions are defined by organizations and used only in those limited circumstances. Audit events are defined in [AU-2](#au-2) . Audit records are generated in [AU-12](#au-12).

## Assessment Objectives
an audited override of automated access control mechanisms is employed under conditions under which to employ an audited override of automated access control mechanisms are defined; by roles allowed to employ an audited override of automated access control mechanisms are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing access enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  conditions for employing audited override of automated access control mechanisms  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with access enforcement responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing access enforcement functions
