## Control Statement
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

## Implementation Guidance
Virtual private networks can be used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an example of a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end communications security over networks and is used for Internet communications and online transactions.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing remote access to the system  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  cryptographic mechanisms and associated configuration documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Cryptographic mechanisms protecting confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions
