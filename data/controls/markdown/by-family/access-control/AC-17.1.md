Monitoring and control of remote access methods allows organizations to detect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies by auditing the connection activities of remote users on a variety of system components, including servers, notebook computers, workstations, smart phones, and tablets. Audit logging for remote access is enforced by [AU-2](#au-2) . Audit events are defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a).

## Assessment Objectives
automated mechanisms are employed to monitor remote access methods; automated mechanisms are employed to control remote access methods.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing remote access to the system  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system monitoring records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Automated mechanisms monitoring and controlling remote access methods
