## Control Statement
Authorize the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access only in a format that provides assessable evidence and for the following needs: organization-defined needs ; and Document the rationale for remote access in the security plan for the system.

## Implementation Guidance
Remote access to systems represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. As such, restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and the susceptibility to threats by adversaries to the remote access capability.

## Assessment Objectives
the execution of privileged commands via remote access is authorized only in a format that provides assessable evidence; access to security-relevant information via remote access is authorized only in a format that provides assessable evidence; the execution of privileged commands via remote access is authorized only for the following needs: needs requiring execution of privileged commands via remote access are defined;; access to security-relevant information via remote access is authorized only for the following needs: needs requiring access to security-relevant information via remote access are defined;; the rationale for remote access is documented in the security plan for the system.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing remote access to the system  system configuration settings and associated documentation  security plan  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing remote access management
