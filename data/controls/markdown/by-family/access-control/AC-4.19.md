## Control Statement
When transferring information between different security domains, implement organization-defined security or privacy policy filters on metadata.

## Implementation Guidance
All information (including metadata and the data to which the metadata applies) is subject to filtering and inspection. Some organizations distinguish between metadata and data payloads (i.e., only the data to which the metadata is bound). Other organizations do not make such distinctions and consider metadata and the data to which the metadata applies to be part of the payload.

## Assessment Objectives
when transferring information between different security domains, security policy filters implemented on metadata are defined (if selected); are implemented on metadata; when transferring information between different security domains, privacy policy filters implemented on metadata are defined (if selected); are implemented on metadata.

## Assessment Methods
Information flow enforcement policy  information flow control policies  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of security policy filtering criteria applied to metadata and data payloads  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information flow enforcement responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with privacy responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement functions  security and policy filters
