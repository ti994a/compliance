## Control Statement
Dynamically associate security and privacy attributes with organization-defined subjects and objects in accordance with the following security and privacy policies as information is created and combined: organization-defined security and privacy policies.

## Implementation Guidance
Dynamic association of attributes is appropriate whenever the security or privacy characteristics of information change over time. Attributes may change due to information aggregation issues (i.e., characteristics of individual data elements are different from the combined elements), changes in individual access authorizations (i.e., privileges), changes in the security category of information, or changes in security or privacy policies. Attributes may also change situationally.

## Assessment Objectives
security attributes are dynamically associated with subjects with which security attributes are dynamically associated as information is created and combined are defined; in accordance with the following security policies as information is created and combined: security policies requiring dynamic association of security attributes with subjects and objects are defined;; security attributes are dynamically associated with objects with which security attributes are dynamically associated as information is created and combined are defined; in accordance with the following security policies as information is created and combined: security policies requiring dynamic association of security attributes with subjects and objects are defined;; privacy attributes are dynamically associated with subjects with which privacy attributes are dynamically associated as information is created and combined are defined; in accordance with the following privacy policies as information is created and combined: privacy policies requiring dynamic association of privacy attributes with subjects and objects are defined;; privacy attributes are dynamically associated with objects with which privacy attributes are dynamically associated as information is created and combined are defined; in accordance with the following privacy policies as information is created and combined: privacy policies requiring dynamic association of privacy attributes with subjects and objects are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing dynamic association of security and privacy attributes to information  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system developers Automated mechanisms implementing dynamic association of security and privacy attributes to information
