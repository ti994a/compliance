## Control Statement
Develop, document, and disseminate to organization-defined personnel or roles: organization-level access control policy that: Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and the associated access controls; Designate an an official to manage the access control policy and procedures is defined; to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the access control policy and procedures; and Review and update the current access control: Policy the frequency at which the current access control policy is reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require the current access control policy reviewed and updated are defined; ; and Procedures the frequency at which the current access control procedures are reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Access control policy and procedures address the controls in the AC family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Assessment Objectives
an access control policy is developed and documented; the access control policy is disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the access control policy is disseminated; access control procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated controls are developed and documented; the access control procedures are disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the access control procedures are disseminated; the organization-level access control policy addresses purpose; the organization-level access control policy addresses scope; the organization-level access control policy addresses roles; the organization-level access control policy addresses responsibilities; the organization-level access control policy addresses management commitment; the organization-level access control policy addresses coordination among organizational entities; the organization-level access control policy addresses compliance; the organization-level access control policy is consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; the an official to manage the access control policy and procedures is defined; is designated to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the access control policy and procedures; the current access control policy is reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current access control policy is reviewed and updated is defined;; the current access control policy is reviewed and updated following events that would require the current access control policy reviewed and updated are defined;; the current access control procedures are reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current access control procedures are reviewed and updated is defined;; the current access control procedures are reviewed and updated following events that would require procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.
