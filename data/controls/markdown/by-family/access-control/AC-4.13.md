## Control Statement
When transferring information between different security domains, decompose information into policy-relevant subcomponents into which to decompose information for submission to policy enforcement mechanisms are defined; for submission to policy enforcement mechanisms.

## Implementation Guidance
Decomposing information into policy-relevant subcomponents prior to information transfer facilitates policy decisions on source, destination, certificates, classification, attachments, and other security- or privacy-related component differentiators. Policy enforcement mechanisms apply filtering, inspection, and/or sanitization rules to the policy-relevant subcomponents of information to facilitate flow enforcement prior to transferring such information to different security domains.

## Assessment Objectives
when transferring information between different security domains, information is decomposed into policy-relevant subcomponents into which to decompose information for submission to policy enforcement mechanisms are defined; for submission to policy enforcement mechanisms.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  information flow control policies  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy
