## Control Statement
Designate individuals authorized to make information publicly accessible; Train authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic information; Review the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible system to ensure that nonpublic information is not included; and Review the content on the publicly accessible system for nonpublic information the frequency at which to review the content on the publicly accessible system for non-public information is defined; and remove such information, if discovered.

## Implementation Guidance
In accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines, the public is not authorized to have access to nonpublic information, including information protected under the [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) and proprietary information. Publicly accessible content addresses systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the public, typically without identification or authentication. Posting information on non-organizational systems (e.g., non-organizational public websites, forums, and social media) is covered by organizational policy. While organizations may have individuals who are responsible for developing and implementing policies about the information that can be made publicly accessible, publicly accessible content addresses the management of the individuals who make such information publicly accessible.

## Assessment Objectives
designated individuals are authorized to make information publicly accessible; authorized individuals are trained to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain non-public information; the proposed content of information is reviewed prior to posting onto the publicly accessible system to ensure that non-public information is not included; the content on the publicly accessible system is reviewed for non-public information the frequency at which to review the content on the publicly accessible system for non-public information is defined;; non-public information is removed from the publicly accessible system, if discovered.
