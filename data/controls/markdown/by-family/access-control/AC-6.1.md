## Control Statement
Authorize access for individuals and roles with authorized access to security functions and security-relevant information are defined; to: organization-defined security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) ; and security-relevant information for authorized access is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Security functions include establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), configuring settings for events to be audited, and establishing intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes filtering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, cryptographic key management information, and access control lists. Authorized personnel include security administrators, system administrators, system security officers, system programmers, and other privileged users.

## Assessment Objectives
access is authorized for individuals and roles with authorized access to security functions and security-relevant information are defined; to security functions (deployed in hardware) for authorized access are defined;; access is authorized for individuals and roles with authorized access to security functions and security-relevant information are defined; to security functions (deployed in software) for authorized access are defined;; access is authorized for individuals and roles with authorized access to security functions and security-relevant information are defined; to security functions (deployed in firmware) for authorized access are defined;; access is authorized for individuals and roles with authorized access to security functions and security-relevant information are defined; to security-relevant information for authorized access is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing least privilege  list of security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information for which access must be explicitly authorized  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Mechanisms implementing least privilege functions
