## Control Statement
Purge or wipe information from mobile devices purged or wiped of information are defined; based on purging and wiping requirements and techniques used when mobile devices are purged or wiped of information are defined; after the number of consecutive, unsuccessful logon attempts before the information is purged or wiped from mobile devices is defined; consecutive, unsuccessful device logon attempts.

## Implementation Guidance
A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Purging or wiping the device applies only to mobile devices for which the organization-defined number of unsuccessful logons occurs. The logon is to the mobile device, not to any one account on the device. Successful logons to accounts on mobile devices reset the unsuccessful logon count to zero. Purging or wiping may be unnecessary if the information on the device is protected with sufficiently strong encryption mechanisms.

## Assessment Objectives
information is purged or wiped from mobile devices purged or wiped of information are defined; based on purging and wiping requirements and techniques used when mobile devices are purged or wiped of information are defined; after the number of consecutive, unsuccessful logon attempts before the information is purged or wiped from mobile devices is defined; consecutive, unsuccessful device logon attempts.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing unsuccessful logon attempts on mobile devices  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of mobile devices to be purged/wiped after organization-defined consecutive, unsuccessful device logon attempts  list of purging/wiping requirements or techniques for mobile devices  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing access control policy for unsuccessful device logon attempts
