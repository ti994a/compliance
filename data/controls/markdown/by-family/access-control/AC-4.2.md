## Control Statement
Use protected processing domains to enforce information flow control policies enforced by use of protected processing domains are defined; as a basis for flow control decisions.

## Implementation Guidance
Protected processing domains within systems are processing spaces that have controlled interactions with other processing spaces, enabling control of information flows between these spaces and to/from information objects. A protected processing domain can be provided, for example, by implementing domain and type enforcement. In domain and type enforcement, system processes are assigned to domains, information is identified by types, and information flows are controlled based on allowed information accesses (i.e., determined by domain and type), allowed signaling among domains, and allowed process transitions to other domains.

## Assessment Objectives
protected processing domains are used to enforce information flow control policies enforced by use of protected processing domains are defined; as a basis for flow control decisions.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  information flow control policies  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system security architecture and associated documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy
