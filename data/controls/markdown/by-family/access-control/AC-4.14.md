## Control Statement
When transferring information between different security domains, implement organization-defined security or privacy policy filters requiring fully enumerated formats that restrict data structure and content.

## Implementation Guidance
Data structure and content restrictions reduce the range of potential malicious or unsanctioned content in cross-domain transactions. Security or privacy policy filters that restrict data structures include restricting file sizes and field lengths. Data content policy filters include encoding formats for character sets, restricting character data fields to only contain alpha-numeric characters, prohibiting special characters, and validating schema structures.

## Assessment Objectives
when transferring information between different security domains, implemented security policy filters implemented that require fully enumerated formats restricting data structure and content have been defined; require fully enumerated formats that restrict data structure and content; when transferring information between different security domains, implemented privacy policy filters implemented that require fully enumerated formats restricting data structure and content are defined; require fully enumerated formats that restrict data structure and content.
