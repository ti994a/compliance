## Control Statement
Select radio antennas and calibrate transmission power levels to reduce the probability that signals from wireless access points can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries.

## Implementation Guidance
Actions that may be taken to limit unauthorized use of wireless communications outside of organization-controlled boundaries include reducing the power of wireless transmissions so that the transmissions are less likely to emit a signal that can be captured outside of the physical perimeters of the organization, employing measures such as emissions security to control wireless emanations, and using directional or beamforming antennas that reduce the likelihood that unintended receivers will be able to intercept signals. Prior to taking such mitigating actions, organizations can conduct periodic wireless surveys to understand the radio frequency profile of organizational systems as well as other systems that may be operating in the area.

## Assessment Objectives
radio antennas are selected to reduce the probability that signals from wireless access points can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries; transmission power levels are calibrated to reduce the probability that signals from wireless access points can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing wireless implementation and usage (including restrictions)  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Calibration of transmission power levels for wireless access  radio antenna signals for wireless access  wireless access reception outside of organization-controlled boundaries
