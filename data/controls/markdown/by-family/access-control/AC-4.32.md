## Control Statement
When transferring information between different security domains, the process that transfers information between filter pipelines: Does not filter message content; Validates filtering metadata; Ensures the content associated with the filtering metadata has successfully completed filtering; and Transfers the content to the destination filter pipeline.

## Implementation Guidance
The processes transferring information between filter pipelines have minimum complexity and functionality to provide assurance that the processes operate correctly.

## Assessment Objectives
when transferring information between different security domains, the process that transfers information between filter pipelines does not filter message content; when transferring information between different security domains, the process that transfers information between filter pipelines validates filtering metadata; when transferring information between different security domains, the process that transfers information between filter pipelines ensures that the content with the filtering metadata has successfully completed filtering; when transferring information between different security domains, the process that transfers information between filter pipelines transfers the content to the destination filter pipeline.

## Assessment Methods
