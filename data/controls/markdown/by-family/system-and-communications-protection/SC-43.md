## Control Statement
Establish usage restrictions and implementation guidelines for the following system components: the components for which usage restrictions and implementation guidance are established are defined; ; and Authorize, monitor, and control the use of such components within the system.

## Implementation Guidance
Usage restrictions apply to all system components including but not limited to mobile code, mobile devices, wireless access, and wired and wireless peripheral components (e.g., copiers, printers, scanners, optical devices, and other similar technologies). The usage restrictions and implementation guidelines are based on the potential for system components to cause damage to the system and help to ensure that only authorized system use occurs.

## Assessment Objectives
usage restrictions and implementation guidelines are established for the components for which usage restrictions and implementation guidance are established are defined;; the use of the components for which usage restrictions and implementation guidance are established are defined; is authorized within the system; the use of the components for which usage restrictions and implementation guidance are established are defined; is monitored within the system; the use of the components for which usage restrictions and implementation guidance are established are defined; is controlled within the system.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  usage restrictions  procedures addressing usage restrictions  implementation policy and procedures  authorization records  system monitoring records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system Organizational processes for authorizing, monitoring, and controlling the use of components with usage restrictions  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing, authorizing, monitoring, and controlling the use of components with usage restrictions
