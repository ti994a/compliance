## Control Statement
Terminate the network connection associated with a communications session at the end of the session or after a time period of inactivity after which the system terminates a network connection associated with a communication session is defined; of inactivity.

## Implementation Guidance
Network disconnect applies to internal and external networks. Terminating network connections associated with specific communications sessions includes de-allocating TCP/IP address or port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating the networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. Periods of inactivity may be established by organizations and include time periods by type of network access or for specific network accesses.

## Assessment Objectives
the network connection associated with a communication session is terminated at the end of the session or after a time period of inactivity after which the system terminates a network connection associated with a communication session is defined; of inactivity.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing network disconnect  system design documentation  security plan  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing a network disconnect capability
