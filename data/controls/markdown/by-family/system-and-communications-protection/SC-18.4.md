## Control Statement
Prevent the automatic execution of mobile code in software applications in which the automatic execution of mobile code is prevented are defined; and enforce actions enforced by the system prior to executing mobile code are defined; prior to executing the code.

## Implementation Guidance
Actions enforced before executing mobile code include prompting users prior to opening email attachments or clicking on web links. Preventing the automatic execution of mobile code includes disabling auto-execute features on system components that employ portable storage devices, such as compact discs, digital versatile discs, and universal serial bus devices.

## Assessment Objectives
the automatic execution of mobile code in software applications in which the automatic execution of mobile code is prevented are defined; is prevented; actions enforced by the system prior to executing mobile code are defined; are enforced prior to executing mobile code.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing mobile code  mobile code usage restrictions  mobile code implementation policy and procedures  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of software applications in which the automatic execution of mobile code must be prohibited  list of actions required before execution of mobile code  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing mobile code Mechanisms preventing the automatic execution of unacceptable mobile code  mechanisms enforcing actions to be taken prior to the execution of the mobile code
