## Control Statement
Implement physically separate subnetworks to isolate the following critical system components and functions: critical system components and functions isolated are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Separating critical system components and functions from other noncritical system components and functions through separate subnetworks may be necessary to reduce susceptibility to a catastrophic or debilitating breach or compromise that results in system failure. For example, physically separating the command and control function from the in-flight entertainment function through separate subnetworks in a commercial aircraft provides an increased level of assurance in the trustworthiness of critical system functions.

## Assessment Objectives
subnetworks are separated physically to isolate critical system components and functions isolated are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing boundary protection  system design documentation  system hardware and software  system architecture  system configuration settings and associated documentation  criticality analysis  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities Mechanisms separating critical system components and functions
