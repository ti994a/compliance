## Control Statement
Implement a policy enforcement mechanism physically between the physical and/or network interfaces for the connecting security domains.

## Implementation Guidance
For logical policy enforcement mechanisms, organizations avoid creating a logical path between interfaces to prevent the ability to bypass the policy enforcement mechanism. For physical policy enforcement mechanisms, the robustness of physical isolation afforded by the physical implementation of policy enforcement to preclude the presence of logical covert channels penetrating the security domain may be needed. Contact [ncdsmo@nsa.gov](mailto:ncdsmo@nsa.gov) for more information.

## Assessment Objectives
a policy enforcement mechanism is physically implemented between the physical and/or network interfaces for the connecting security domains.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing cross-domain policy enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing cross-domain policy enforcement
