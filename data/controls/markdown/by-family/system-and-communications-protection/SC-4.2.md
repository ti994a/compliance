## Control Statement
Prevent unauthorized information transfer via shared resources in accordance with procedures to prevent unauthorized information transfer via shared resources are defined; when system processing explicitly switches between different information classification levels or security categories.

## Implementation Guidance
Changes in processing levels can occur during multilevel or periods processing with information at different classification levels or security categories. It can also occur during serial reuse of hardware components at different classification levels. Organization-defined procedures can include approved sanitization processes for electronically stored information.

## Assessment Objectives
unauthorized information transfer via shared resources is prevented in accordance with procedures to prevent unauthorized information transfer via shared resources are defined; when system processing explicitly switches between different information classification levels or security categories.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing information protection in shared system resources  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Mechanisms preventing the unauthorized transfer of information via shared system resources
