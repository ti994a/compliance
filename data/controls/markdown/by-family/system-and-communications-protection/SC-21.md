## Control Statement
Request and perform data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.

## Implementation Guidance
Each client of name resolution services either performs this validation on its own or has authenticated channels to trusted validation providers. Systems that provide name and address resolution services for local clients include recursive resolving or caching domain name system (DNS) servers. DNS client resolvers either perform validation of DNSSEC signatures, or clients use authenticated channels to recursive resolvers that perform such validations. Systems that use technologies other than the DNS to map between host and service names and network addresses provide some other means to enable clients to verify the authenticity and integrity of response data.

## Assessment Objectives
data origin authentication is requested for the name/address resolution responses that the system receives from authoritative sources; data origin authentication is performed on the name/address resolution responses that the system receives from authoritative sources; data integrity verification is requested for the name/address resolution responses that the system receives from authoritative sources; data integrity verification is performed on the name/address resolution responses that the system receives from authoritative sources.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing secure name/address resolution services (recursive or caching resolver)  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing DNS Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing data origin authentication and data integrity verification for name/address resolution services
