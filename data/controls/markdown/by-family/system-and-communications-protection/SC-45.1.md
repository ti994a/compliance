## Control Statement
Compare the internal system clocks the frequency at which to compare the internal system clocks with the authoritative time source is defined; with the authoritative time source to which internal system clocks are compared is defined; ; and Synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than the time period to compare the internal system clocks with the authoritative time source is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Synchronization of internal system clocks with an authoritative source provides uniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.

## Assessment Objectives
the internal system clocks are compared the frequency at which to compare the internal system clocks with the authoritative time source is defined; with the authoritative time source to which internal system clocks are compared is defined;; the internal system clocks are synchronized with the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than the time period to compare the internal system clocks with the authoritative time source is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing time synchronization  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system time synchronization
