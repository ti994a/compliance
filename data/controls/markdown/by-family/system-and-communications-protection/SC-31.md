## Control Statement
Perform a covert channel analysis to identify those aspects of communications within the system that are potential avenues for covert storage channels; and Estimate the maximum bandwidth of those channels.

## Implementation Guidance
Developers are in the best position to identify potential areas within systems that might lead to covert channels. Covert channel analysis is a meaningful activity when there is the potential for unauthorized information flows across security domains, such as in the case of systems that contain export-controlled information and have connections to external networks (i.e., networks that are not controlled by organizations). Covert channel analysis is also useful for multilevel secure systems, multiple security level systems, and cross-domain systems.

## Assessment Objectives
a covert channel analysis is performed to identify those aspects of communications within the system that are potential avenues for covert storage channels; the maximum bandwidth of those channels is estimated.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing covert channel analysis  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  covert channel analysis documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with covert channel analysis responsibilities  system developers/integrators Organizational process for conducting covert channel analysis  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing covert channel analysis  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the capability to estimate the bandwidth of covert channels
