## Control Statement
Include system components that proactively seek to identify network-based malicious code or malicious websites.

## Implementation Guidance
External malicious code identification differs from decoys in [SC-26](#sc-26) in that the components actively probe networks, including the Internet, in search of malicious code contained on external websites. Like decoys, the use of external malicious code identification techniques requires some supporting isolation measures to ensure that any malicious code discovered during the search and subsequently executed does not infect organizational systems. Virtualization is a common technique for achieving such isolation.

## Assessment Objectives
system components that proactively seek to identify network-based malicious code or malicious websites are included.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing external malicious code identification  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system components deployed to identify malicious websites and/or web-based malicious code  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  system developers/integrators Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing external malicious code identification
