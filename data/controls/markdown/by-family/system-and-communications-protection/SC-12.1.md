## Control Statement
Maintain availability of information in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys by users.

## Implementation Guidance
Escrowing of encryption keys is a common practice for ensuring availability in the event of key loss. A forgotten passphrase is an example of losing a cryptographic key.

## Assessment Objectives
information availability is maintained in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys by users.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing cryptographic key establishment, management, and recovery  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibilities for cryptographic key establishment or management Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing cryptographic key establishment and management
