## Control Statement
Protect external and internal organization-defined wireless links from the following signal parameter attacks: organization-defined types of signal parameter attacks or references to sources for such attacks.

## Implementation Guidance
Wireless link protection applies to internal and external wireless communication links that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized system users. Adversaries can exploit the signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not adequately protected. There are many ways to exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service, or spoof system users. Protection of wireless links reduces the impact of attacks that are unique to wireless systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for transmission services as commodity items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be possible to implement wireless link protections to the extent necessary to meet organizational security requirements.

## Assessment Objectives
external external wireless links protected from particular types of signal parameter attacks are defined; are protected from types of signal parameter attacks or references to sources for such attacks from which to protect external wireless links are defined;. internal internal wireless links protected from particular types of signal parameter attacks are defined; are protected from types of signal parameter attacks or references to sources for such attacks from which to protect internal wireless links are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  access control policy and procedures  procedures addressing wireless link protection  system design documentation  wireless network diagrams  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  list of internal and external wireless links  list of signal parameter attacks or references to sources for attacks  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel authorizing, installing, configuring, and/or maintaining internal and external wireless links Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the protection of wireless links
