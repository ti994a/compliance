## Control Statement
Prohibit the direct connection of the unclassified national security system prohibited from directly connecting to an external network is defined; to an external network without the use of the boundary protection device required for a direct connection to an external network is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
A direct connection is a dedicated physical or virtual connection between two or more systems. Organizations typically do not have complete control over external networks, including the Internet. Boundary protection devices (e.g., firewalls, gateways, and routers) mediate communications and information flows between unclassified national security systems and external networks.

## Assessment Objectives
the direct connection of the unclassified national security system prohibited from directly connecting to an external network is defined; to an external network without the use of the boundary protection device required for a direct connection to an external network is defined; is prohibited.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing boundary protection  system design documentation  system hardware and software  system architecture  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities Mechanisms prohibiting the direct connection of unclassified national security systems to an external network
