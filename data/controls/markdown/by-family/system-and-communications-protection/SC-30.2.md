## Control Statement
Employ techniques employed to introduce randomness into organizational operations and assets are defined; to introduce randomness into organizational operations and assets.

## Implementation Guidance
Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries regarding the actions that organizations take to defend their systems against attacks. Such actions may impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations that support critical missions or business functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries to hesitate before initiating or continuing attacks. Misdirection techniques that involve randomness include performing certain routine actions at different times of day, employing different information technologies, using different suppliers, and rotating roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel.

## Assessment Objectives
techniques employed to introduce randomness into organizational operations and assets are defined; are employed to introduce randomness into organizational operations and assets.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing concealment and misdirection techniques for the system  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  list of techniques to be employed to introduce randomness into organizational operations and assets  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with the responsibility to implement concealment and misdirection techniques for systems Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing randomness as a concealment and misdirection technique
