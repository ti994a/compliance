## Control Statement
Maintain a separate execution domain for each executing system process.

## Implementation Guidance
Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each system process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces. Process isolation technologies, including sandboxing or virtualization, logically separate software and firmware from other software, firmware, and data. Process isolation helps limit the access of potentially untrusted software to other system resources. The capability to maintain separate execution domains is available in commercial operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.

## Assessment Objectives
a separate execution domain is maintained for each executing system process.

## Assessment Methods
System design documentation  system architecture  independent verification and validation documentation  testing and evaluation documentation  other relevant documents or records System developers/integrators  system security architect Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing separate execution domains for each executing process
