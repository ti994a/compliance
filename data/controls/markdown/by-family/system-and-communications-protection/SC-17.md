## Control Statement
Issue public key certificates under an a certificate policy for issuing public key certificates is defined; or obtain public key certificates from an approved service provider; and Include only approved trust anchors in trust stores or certificate stores managed by the organization.

## Implementation Guidance
Public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates are certificates with visibility external to organizational systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems, such as application-specific time services. In cryptographic systems with a hierarchical structure, a trust anchor is an authoritative source (i.e., a certificate authority) for which trust is assumed and not derived. A root certificate for a PKI system is an example of a trust anchor. A trust store or certificate store maintains a list of trusted root certificates.

## Assessment Objectives
public key certificates are issued under a certificate policy for issuing public key certificates is defined; , or public key certificates are obtained from an approved service provider; only approved trust anchors are included in trust stores or certificate stores managed by the organization.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing public key infrastructure certificates  public key certificate policy or policies  public key issuing process  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibilities for issuing public key certificates  service providers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the management of public key infrastructure certificates
