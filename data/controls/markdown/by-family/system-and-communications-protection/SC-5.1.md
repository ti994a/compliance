## Control Statement
Restrict the ability of individuals to launch the following denial-of-service attacks against other systems: denial-of-service attacks for which to restrict the ability of individuals to launch are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial-of-service attacks requires the mechanisms commonly used for such attacks to be unavailable. Individuals of concern include hostile insiders or external adversaries who have breached or compromised the system and are using it to launch a denial-of-service attack. Organizations can restrict the ability of individuals to connect and transmit arbitrary information on the transport medium (i.e., wired networks, wireless networks, spoofed Internet protocol packets). Organizations can also limit the ability of individuals to use excessive system resources. Protection against individuals having the ability to launch denial-of-service attacks may be implemented on specific systems or boundary devices that prohibit egress to potential target systems.

## Assessment Objectives
the ability of individuals to launch denial-of-service attacks for which to restrict the ability of individuals to launch are defined; against other systems is restricted.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing denial-of-service protection  system design documentation  list of denial-of-service attacks launched by individuals against systems  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with incident response responsibilities  system developer Mechanisms restricting the ability to launch denial-of-service attacks against other systems
