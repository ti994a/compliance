## Control Statement
Protect the authenticity of communications sessions.

## Implementation Guidance
Protecting session authenticity addresses communications protection at the session level, not at the packet level. Such protection establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in the ongoing identities of other parties and the validity of transmitted information. Authenticity protection includes protecting against "man-in-the-middle" attacks, session hijacking, and the insertion of false information into sessions.

## Assessment Objectives
the authenticity of communication sessions is protected.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing session authenticity  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing session authenticity
