## Control Statement
Fail to a known system state to which system components fail in the event of a system failure is defined; for the following failures on the indicated components while preserving system state information preserved in the event of a system failure is defined; in failure: types of system failures for which the system components fail to a known state are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Failure in a known state addresses security concerns in accordance with the mission and business needs of organizations. Failure in a known state prevents the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information in the event of failures of organizational systems or system components. Failure in a known safe state helps to prevent systems from failing to a state that may cause injury to individuals or destruction to property. Preserving system state information facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode with less disruption of mission and business processes.

## Assessment Objectives
types of system failures for which the system components fail to a known state are defined; fail to a known system state to which system components fail in the event of a system failure is defined; while preserving system state information preserved in the event of a system failure is defined; in failure.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing system failure to known state  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of failures requiring system to fail in a known state  state information to be preserved in system failure  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the fail in known state capability  mechanisms preserving system state information in the event of a system failure
