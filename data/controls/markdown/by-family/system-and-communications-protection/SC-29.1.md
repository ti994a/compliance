## Control Statement
Employ virtualization techniques to support the deployment of a diversity of operating systems and applications that are changed the frequency at which to change the diversity of operating systems and applications deployed using virtualization techniques is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
While frequent changes to operating systems and applications can pose significant configuration management challenges, the changes can result in an increased work factor for adversaries to conduct successful attacks. Changing virtual operating systems or applications, as opposed to changing actual operating systems or applications, provides virtual changes that impede attacker success while reducing configuration management efforts. Virtualization techniques can assist in isolating untrustworthy software or software of dubious provenance into confined execution environments.

## Assessment Objectives
virtualization techniques are employed to support the deployment of a diverse range of operating systems and applications that are changed the frequency at which to change the diversity of operating systems and applications deployed using virtualization techniques is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  configuration management policy and procedures  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  list of operating systems and applications deployed using virtualization techniques  change control records  configuration management records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibilities for implementing approved virtualization techniques to the system Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the employment of a diverse set of information technologies  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing virtualization techniques
