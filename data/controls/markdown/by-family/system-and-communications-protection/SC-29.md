## Control Statement
Employ a diverse set of information technologies for the following system components in the implementation of the system: system components requiring a diverse set of information technologies employed in the implementation of the system are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations or compromises of specific technologies. Such diversity protects against common mode failures, including those failures induced by supply chain attacks. Diversity in information technologies also reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to compromise one system component will be effective against other system components, thus further increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned attacks. An increase in diversity may add complexity and management overhead that could ultimately lead to mistakes and unauthorized configurations.

## Assessment Objectives
a diverse set of information technologies is employed for system components requiring a diverse set of information technologies employed in the implementation of the system are defined; in the implementation of the system.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of technologies deployed in the system  acquisition documentation  acquisition contracts for system components or services  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with system acquisition, development, and implementation responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the employment of a diverse set of information technologies
