## Control Statement
Isolate security functions enforcing access and information flow control from nonsecurity functions and from other security functions.

## Implementation Guidance
Security function isolation occurs because of implementation. The functions can still be scanned and monitored. Security functions that are potentially isolated from access and flow control enforcement functions include auditing, intrusion detection, and malicious code protection functions.

## Assessment Objectives
security functions enforcing access control are isolated from non-security functions; security functions enforcing access control are isolated from other security functions; security functions enforcing information flow control are isolated from non-security functions; security functions enforcing information flow control are isolated from other security functions.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing security function isolation  list of critical security functions  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Isolation of security functions enforcing access and information flow control
