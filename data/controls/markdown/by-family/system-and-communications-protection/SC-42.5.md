## Control Statement
Employ the sensors that are configured to minimize the collection of unneeded information about individuals are defined; that are configured to minimize the collection of information about individuals that is not needed.

## Implementation Guidance
Although policies to control for authorized use can be applied to information once it is collected, minimizing the collection of information that is not needed mitigates privacy risk at the system entry point and mitigates the risk of policy control failures. Sensor configurations include the obscuring of human features, such as blurring or pixelating flesh tones.

## Assessment Objectives
the the sensors that are configured to minimize the collection of unneeded information about individuals are defined; configured to minimize the collection of information about individuals that is not needed are employed.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  access control policy and procedures  personally identifiable information processing policy  sensor capability and data collection policy and procedures  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  privacy risk assessment documentation  privacy impact assessments  system architecture  list of information being collected by sensors  list of sensor configurations that minimize the collection of personally identifiable information (e.g., obscure human features)  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for sensor capabilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing measures to facilitate the review of information that is being collected by sensors  sensor information collection capabilities for the system
