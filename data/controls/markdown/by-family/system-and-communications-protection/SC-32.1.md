## Assessment Objectives
privileged functions are partitioned into separate physical domains.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing system partitioning  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  list of system physical domains (or environments)  system facility diagrams  system network diagrams  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  system developers/integrators Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the physical separation of system components
