## Control Statement
Reduce the maximum bandwidth for identified covert storage channels to values for the maximum bandwidth for identified covert channels are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The complete elimination of covert channels, especially covert timing channels, is usually not possible without significant performance impacts.

## Assessment Objectives
