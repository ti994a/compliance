## Control Statement
Implement cryptographic mechanisms that achieve level of protection employed against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference is defined; against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference.

## Implementation Guidance
The implementation of cryptographic mechanisms for electromagnetic interference protects systems against intentional jamming that might deny or impair communications by ensuring that wireless spread spectrum waveforms used to provide anti-jam protection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. The implementation of cryptographic mechanisms may also coincidentally mitigate the effects of unintentional jamming due to interference from legitimate transmitters that share the same spectrum. Mission requirements, projected threats, concept of operations, and laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, and standards determine levels of wireless link availability, cryptography needed, and performance.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms that achieve level of protection employed against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference is defined; against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference are implemented.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  access control policy and procedures  procedures addressing wireless link protection  system design documentation  wireless network diagrams  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  system communications hardware and software  security categorization results  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel authorizing, installing, configuring, and/or maintaining internal and external wireless links Cryptographic mechanisms enforcing protections against effects of intentional electromagnetic interference
