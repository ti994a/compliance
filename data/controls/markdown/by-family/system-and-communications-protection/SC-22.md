## Control Statement
Ensure the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service for an organization are fault-tolerant and implement internal and external role separation.

## Implementation Guidance
Systems that provide name and address resolution services include domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure in systems and enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system servers—one configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with internal roles only process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., from internal clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks, including the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative DNS servers in certain roles (e.g., by address ranges and explicit lists).

## Assessment Objectives
the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution services for an organization are fault-tolerant; the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution services for an organization implement internal role separation; the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution services for an organization implement external role separation.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing architecture and provisioning for name/address resolution services  access control policy and procedures  system design documentation  assessment results from independent testing organizations  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing DNS Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing name/address resolution services for fault tolerance and role separation
