## Control Statement
Employ polling techniques to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to the following processing and storage components: distributed processing and storage components for which polling techniques are employed to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises are defined; ; and Take the following actions in response to identified faults, errors, or compromises: actions taken in response to identified faults, errors, or compromise are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Distributed processing and/or storage may be used to reduce opportunities for adversaries to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of organizational information and systems. However, the distribution of processing and storage components does not prevent adversaries from compromising one or more of the components. Polling compares the processing results and/or storage content from the distributed components and subsequently votes on the outcomes. Polling identifies potential faults, compromises, or errors in the distributed processing and storage components.

## Assessment Objectives
polling techniques are employed to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to distributed processing and storage components for which polling techniques are employed to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises are defined;; actions taken in response to identified faults, errors, or compromise are defined; are taken in response to identified faults, errors, or compromise.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  list of distributed processing and storage components subject to polling  system polling techniques and associated documentation or records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  system developers/integrators Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing polling techniques
