## Control Statement
Distribute the following processing and storage components across multiple physical locations: organization-defined processing and storage components.

## Implementation Guidance
Distributing processing and storage across multiple physical locations or logical domains provides a degree of redundancy or overlap for organizations. The redundancy and overlap increase the work factor of adversaries to adversely impact organizational operations, assets, and individuals. The use of distributed processing and storage does not assume a single primary processing or storage location. Therefore, it allows for parallel processing and storage.

## Assessment Objectives
processing components distributed across multiple locations/domains are defined; are distributed across physical locations; storage components distributed across multiple locations/domains are defined; are distributed across physical locations.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  contingency planning policy and procedures  contingency plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  list of system physical locations (or environments) with distributed processing and storage  system facility diagrams  processing site agreements  storage site agreements  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel with contingency planning and plan implementation responsibilities  system developers/integrators Organizational processes for distributed processing and storage across multiple physical locations  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the capability to distribute processing and storage across multiple physical locations
