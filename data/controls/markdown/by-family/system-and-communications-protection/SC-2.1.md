## Control Statement
Prevent the presentation of system management functionality at interfaces to non-privileged users.

## Implementation Guidance
Preventing the presentation of system management functionality at interfaces to non-privileged users ensures that system administration options, including administrator privileges, are not available to the general user population. Restricting user access also prohibits the use of the grey-out option commonly used to eliminate accessibility to such information. One potential solution is to withhold system administration options until users establish sessions with administrator privileges.

## Assessment Objectives
the presentation of system management functionality is prevented at interfaces to non-privileged users.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing application partitioning  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  non-privileged users of the system  system developer Separation of user functionality from system management functionality
