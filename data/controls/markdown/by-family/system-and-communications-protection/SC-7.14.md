## Control Statement
Protect against unauthorized physical connections at managed interfaces protected against unauthorized physical connections are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Systems that operate at different security categories or classification levels may share common physical and environmental controls, since the systems may share space within the same facilities. In practice, it is possible that these separate systems may share common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable distribution paths. Protection against unauthorized physical connections can be achieved by using clearly identified and physically separated cable trays, connection frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with physical access controls that enforce limited authorized access to these items.

## Assessment Objectives
managed interfaces protected against unauthorized physical connections are defined; are protected against unauthorized physical connections.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing boundary protection  system design documentation  system hardware and software  system architecture  system configuration settings and associated documentation  facility communications and wiring diagram system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing protection against unauthorized physical connections
