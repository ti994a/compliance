## Control Statement
Implement hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate process isolation.

## Implementation Guidance
Hardware-based separation of system processes is generally less susceptible to compromise than software-based separation, thus providing greater assurance that the separation will be enforced. Hardware separation mechanisms include hardware memory management.

## Assessment Objectives
hardware separation is implemented to facilitate process isolation.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  system documentation for hardware separation mechanisms  system documentation from vendors, manufacturers, or developers  independent verification and validation documentation  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  system developers/integrators System capability implementing underlying hardware separation mechanisms for process separation
