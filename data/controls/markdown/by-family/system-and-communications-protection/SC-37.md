## Control Statement
Employ the following out-of-band channels for the physical delivery or electronic transmission of information, system components, or devices to employ out-of-band-channels for physical delivery or electronic transmission are defined; to individuals or systems to which physical delivery or electronic transmission of information, system components, or devices is achieved via the employment of out-of-band channels are defined;: out-of-band channels employed for the physical delivery or electronic transmission of information, system components, or devices to individuals or the system are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Out-of-band channels include local, non-network accesses to systems; network paths physically separate from network paths used for operational traffic; or non-electronic paths, such as the U.S. Postal Service. The use of out-of-band channels is contrasted with the use of in-band channels (i.e., the same channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels do not have the same vulnerability or exposure as in-band channels. Therefore, the confidentiality, integrity, or availability compromises of in-band channels will not compromise or adversely affect the out-of-band channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission of organizational items, including authenticators and credentials; cryptographic key management information; system and data backups; configuration management changes for hardware, firmware, or software; security updates; maintenance information; and malicious code protection updates. For example, cryptographic keys for encrypted files are delivered using a different channel than the file.

## Assessment Objectives
out-of-band channels employed for the physical delivery or electronic transmission of information, system components, or devices to individuals or the system are defined; are employed for the physical delivery or electronic transmission of information, system components, or devices to employ out-of-band-channels for physical delivery or electronic transmission are defined; to individuals or systems to which physical delivery or electronic transmission of information, system components, or devices is achieved via the employment of out-of-band channels are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing the use of out-of-band channels  access control policy and procedures  identification and authentication policy and procedures  system design documentation  system architecture  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of out-of-band channels  types of information, system components, or devices requiring the use of out-of-band channels for physical delivery or electronic transmission to authorized individuals or systems  physical delivery records  electronic transmission records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel authorizing, installing, configuring, operating, and/or using out-of-band channels  system developers/integrators Organizational processes for the use of out-of-band channels  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the use of out-of-band channels
