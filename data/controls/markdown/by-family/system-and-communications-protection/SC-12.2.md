[SP 800-57-1](#110e26af-4765-49e1-8740-6750f83fcda1), [SP 800-57-2](#e7942589-e267-4a5a-a3d9-f39a7aae81f0) , and [SP 800-57-3](#8306620b-1920-4d73-8b21-12008528595f) provide guidance on cryptographic key management.

## Assessment Objectives
symmetric cryptographic keys are produced using NIST FIPS-validated key management technology and processes; symmetric cryptographic keys are controlled using NIST FIPS-validated key management technology and processes; symmetric cryptographic keys are distributed using NIST FIPS-validated key management technology and processes.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing cryptographic key establishment and management  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  list of FIPS-validated cryptographic products  list of NSA-approved cryptographic products  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with responsibilities for cryptographic key establishment or management Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing symmetric cryptographic key establishment and management
