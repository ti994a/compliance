## Control Statement
Employ the following monitoring tools to detect indicators of denial-of-service attacks against, or launched from, the system: monitoring tools for detecting indicators of denial-of-service attacks are defined; ; and Monitor the following system resources to determine if sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial-of-service attacks: system resources monitored to determine if sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial-of-service attacks are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations consider the utilization and capacity of system resources when managing risk associated with a denial of service due to malicious attacks. Denial-of-service attacks can originate from external or internal sources. System resources that are sensitive to denial of service include physical disk storage, memory, and CPU cycles. Techniques used to prevent denial-of-service attacks related to storage utilization and capacity include instituting disk quotas, configuring systems to automatically alert administrators when specific storage capacity thresholds are reached, using file compression technologies to maximize available storage space, and imposing separate partitions for system and user data.

## Assessment Objectives
monitoring tools for detecting indicators of denial-of-service attacks are defined; are employed to detect indicators of denial-of-service attacks against or launched from the system; system resources monitored to determine if sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial-of-service attacks are defined; are monitored to determine if sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial-of-service attacks.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing denial-of-service protection  system design documentation  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with detection and monitoring responsibilities Mechanisms/tools implementing system monitoring for denial-of-service attacks
