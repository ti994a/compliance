## Control Statement
Generate a unique session identifier for each session with randomness requirements for generating a unique session identifier for each session are defined; and recognize only session identifiers that are system-generated.

## Implementation Guidance
Generating unique session identifiers curtails the ability of adversaries to reuse previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the generation of unique session identifiers protects against brute-force attacks to determine future session identifiers.

## Assessment Objectives
a unique session identifier is generated for each session with randomness requirements for generating a unique session identifier for each session are defined;; only system-generated session identifiers are recognized.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing session authenticity  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms supporting, implementing, generating, and monitoring unique session identifiers  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing randomness requirements
