## Control Statement
Isolate information security tools, mechanisms, and support components isolated from other internal system components are defined; from other internal system components by implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of the system.

## Implementation Guidance
Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational processing networks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques employed by organizations.

## Assessment Objectives
information security tools, mechanisms, and support components isolated from other internal system components are defined; are isolated from other internal system components by implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of the system.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing boundary protection  system design documentation  system hardware and software  system architecture  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of security tools and support components to be isolated from other internal system components  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the isolation of information security tools, mechanisms, and support components
