## Control Statement
Employ the following concealment and misdirection techniques for systems for which concealment and misdirection techniques are employed are defined; at time periods to employ concealment and misdirection techniques for systems are defined; to confuse and mislead adversaries: concealment and misdirection techniques employed to confuse and mislead adversaries potentially targeting systems are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the targeting capabilities of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate and complete attacks. For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations with the ability to disguise systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the cost of having multiple platforms. The increased use of concealment and misdirection techniques and methods—including randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization—may sufficiently confuse and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing tradecraft. Concealment and misdirection techniques may provide additional time to perform core mission and business functions. The implementation of concealment and misdirection techniques may add to the complexity and management overhead required for the system.

## Assessment Objectives
concealment and misdirection techniques employed to confuse and mislead adversaries potentially targeting systems are defined; are employed for systems for which concealment and misdirection techniques are employed are defined; for time periods to employ concealment and misdirection techniques for systems are defined; to confuse and mislead adversaries.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing concealment and misdirection techniques for the system  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  list of concealment and misdirection techniques to be employed for organizational systems  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with the responsibility to implement concealment and misdirection techniques for systems Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing concealment and misdirection techniques
