## Control Statement
Employ a detonation chamber capability within the system, system component, or location where a detonation chamber capability is employed is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Detonation chambers, also known as dynamic execution environments, allow organizations to open email attachments, execute untrusted or suspicious applications, and execute Universal Resource Locator requests in the safety of an isolated environment or a virtualized sandbox. Protected and isolated execution environments provide a means of determining whether the associated attachments or applications contain malicious code. While related to the concept of deception nets, the employment of detonation chambers is not intended to maintain a long-term environment in which adversaries can operate and their actions can be observed. Rather, detonation chambers are intended to quickly identify malicious code and either reduce the likelihood that the code is propagated to user environments of operation or prevent such propagation completely.

## Assessment Objectives
a detonation chamber capability is employed within the the system, system component, or location where a detonation chamber capability is employed is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing detonation chambers  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the detonation chamber capability
