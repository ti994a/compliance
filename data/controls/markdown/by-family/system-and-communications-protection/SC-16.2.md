## Control Statement
Implement anti-spoofing mechanisms to prevent adversaries from falsifying the security attributes indicating the successful application of the security process.

## Implementation Guidance
Some attack vectors operate by altering the security attributes of an information system to intentionally and maliciously implement an insufficient level of security within the system. The alteration of attributes leads organizations to believe that a greater number of security functions are in place and operational than have actually been implemented.

## Assessment Objectives
anti-spoofing mechanisms are implemented to prevent adversaries from falsifying the security attributes indicating the successful application of the security process.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing the transmission of security and privacy attributes  access control policy and procedures  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing anti-spoofing mechanisms
