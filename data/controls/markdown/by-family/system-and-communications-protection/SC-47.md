## Control Statement
Establish alternate communication paths for system operations and operational command and control are defined; for system operations organizational command and control.

## Implementation Guidance
An incident, whether adversarial- or nonadversarial-based, can disrupt established communications paths used for system operations and organizational command and control. Alternate communications paths reduce the risk of all communications paths being affected by the same incident. To compound the problem, the inability of organizational officials to obtain timely information about disruptions or to provide timely direction to operational elements after a communications path incident, can impact the ability of the organization to respond to such incidents in a timely manner. Establishing alternate communications paths for command and control purposes, including designating alternative decision makers if primary decision makers are unavailable and establishing the extent and limitations of their actions, can greatly facilitate the organization’s ability to continue to operate and take appropriate actions during an incident.

## Assessment Objectives
alternate communication paths for system operations and operational command and control are defined; are established for system operations and operational command and control.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing communication paths  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing alternate communication paths for system operations
