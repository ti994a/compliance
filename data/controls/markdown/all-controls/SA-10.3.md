## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to enable integrity verification of hardware components.

## Implementation Guidance
Hardware integrity verification allows organizations to detect unauthorized changes to hardware components using developer-provided tools, techniques, methods, and mechanisms. Organizations may verify the integrity of hardware components with hard-to-copy labels, verifiable serial numbers provided by developers, and by requiring the use of anti-tamper technologies. Delivered hardware components also include hardware and firmware updates to such components.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to enable integrity verification of hardware components.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing system developer configuration management  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  system developer configuration management plan  hardware integrity verification records  system security plan  supply chain risk management plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with configuration management responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities Organizational processes for monitoring developer configuration management  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the monitoring of developer configuration management
