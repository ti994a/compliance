## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a manual code review of specific code requiring manual code review is defined; using the following processes, procedures, and/or techniques: processes, procedures, and/or techniques used for manual code reviews are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Manual code reviews are usually reserved for the critical software and firmware components of systems. Manual code reviews are effective at identifying weaknesses that require knowledge of the application’s requirements or context that, in most cases, is unavailable to automated analytic tools and techniques, such as static and dynamic analysis. The benefits of manual code review include the ability to verify access control matrices against application controls and review detailed aspects of cryptographic implementations and controls.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to perform a manual code review of specific code requiring manual code review is defined; using processes, procedures, and/or techniques used for manual code reviews are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing system developer security testing  processes, procedures, and/or techniques for performing manual code reviews  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  system developer security testing and evaluation plans  system developer security testing and evaluation results  list of code requiring manual reviews  records of manual code reviews  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with developer security testing responsibilities  system developers  independent verification agent Organizational processes for monitoring developer security testing and evaluation  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the monitoring of developer testing and evaluation
