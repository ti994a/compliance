## Control Statement
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to identify and reject wireless transmissions that are deliberate attempts to achieve imitative or manipulative communications deception based on signal parameters.

## Implementation Guidance
The implementation of cryptographic mechanisms to identify and reject imitative or manipulative communications ensures that the signal parameters of wireless transmissions are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. Such unpredictability reduces the probability of imitative or manipulative communications deception based on signal parameters alone.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to identify and reject wireless transmissions that are deliberate attempts to achieve imitative or manipulative communications deception based on signal parameters.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  access control policy and procedures  procedures addressing system design documentation  wireless network diagrams  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  system communications hardware and software  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel authorizing, installing, configuring, and/or maintaining internal and external wireless links Cryptographic mechanisms enforcing wireless link protections against imitative or manipulative communications deception
