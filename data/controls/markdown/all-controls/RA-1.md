## Control Statement
Develop, document, and disseminate to organization-defined personnel or roles: organization-level risk assessment policy that: Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the risk assessment policy and the associated risk assessment controls; Designate an an official to manage the risk assessment policy and procedures is defined; to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the risk assessment policy and procedures; and Review and update the current risk assessment: Policy the frequency at which the current risk assessment policy is reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require the current risk assessment policy reviewed and updated are defined; ; and Procedures the frequency at which the current risk assessment procedures are reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require risk assessment procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Risk assessment policy and procedures address the controls in the RA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of risk assessment policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to risk assessment policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Assessment Objectives
a risk assessment policy is developed and documented; the risk assessment policy is disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the risk assessment policy is disseminated; risk assessment procedures to facilitate the implementation of the risk assessment policy and associated risk assessment controls are developed and documented; the risk assessment procedures are disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the risk assessment procedures are disseminated; the organization-level risk assessment policy addresses purpose; the organization-level risk assessment policy addresses scope; the organization-level risk assessment policy addresses roles; the organization-level risk assessment policy addresses responsibilities; the organization-level risk assessment policy addresses management commitment; the organization-level risk assessment policy addresses coordination among organizational entities; the organization-level risk assessment policy addresses compliance; the organization-level risk assessment policy is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; the an official to manage the risk assessment policy and procedures is defined; is designated to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the risk assessment policy and procedures; the current risk assessment policy is reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current risk assessment policy is reviewed and updated is defined;; the current risk assessment policy is reviewed and updated following events that would require the current risk assessment policy reviewed and updated are defined;; the current risk assessment procedures are reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current risk assessment procedures are reviewed and updated is defined;; the current risk assessment procedures are reviewed and updated following events that would require risk assessment procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.
