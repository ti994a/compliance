## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of sufficient documentation in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of sufficient documentation are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of sufficient documentation states that organizational personnel with responsibilities to interact with the system are provided with adequate documentation and other information such that the personnel contribute to rather than detract from system security. Despite attempts to comply with principles such as human factored security and acceptable security, systems are inherently complex, and the design intent for the use of security mechanisms and the ramifications of the misuse or misconfiguration of security mechanisms are not always intuitively obvious. Uninformed and insufficiently trained users can introduce vulnerabilities due to errors of omission and commission. The availability of documentation and training can help to ensure a knowledgeable cadre of personnel, all of whom have a critical role in the achievement of principles such as continuous protection. Documentation is written clearly and supported by training that provides security awareness and understanding of security-relevant responsibilities.

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of sufficient documentation are defined; implement the security design principle of sufficient documentation.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the security design principle of sufficient documentation used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  change control records  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy documentation  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of sufficient documentation in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of sufficient documentation in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms that enforce security policies  organizational processes for managing change configuration  mechanisms supporting configuration control
