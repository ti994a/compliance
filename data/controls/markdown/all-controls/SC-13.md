## Control Statement
Determine the cryptographic uses are defined; ; and Implement the following types of cryptography required for each specified cryptographic use: types of cryptography for each specified cryptographic use are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions, including the protection of classified information and controlled unclassified information, the provision and implementation of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number and hash generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography. For example, organizations that need to protect classified information may specify the use of NSA-approved cryptography. Organizations that need to provision and implement digital signatures may specify the use of FIPS-validated cryptography. Cryptography is implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic uses are defined; are identified; types of cryptography for each specified cryptographic use are defined; for each specified cryptographic use (defined in SC-13_ODP[01]) are implemented.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing cryptographic protection  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  cryptographic module validation certificates  list of FIPS-validated cryptographic modules  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with responsibilities for cryptographic protection Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing cryptographic protection
