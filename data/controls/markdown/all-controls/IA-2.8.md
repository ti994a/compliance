## Control Statement
Implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to privileged accounts.

## Implementation Guidance
Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include protocols that use nonces or challenges such as time synchronous or cryptographic authenticators.

## Assessment Objectives
replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to privileged accounts are implemented.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing user identification and authentication  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  list of privileged system accounts  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system operations responsibilities  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification and authentication capabilities  Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing replay-resistant authentication mechanisms
