This enhancement excludes intentionally discoverable information that may be part of a decoy capability (e.g., honeypots, honeynets, or deception nets) deployed by the organization.

## Assessment Objectives
information about the system is discoverable; corrective actions taken if information about the system is discoverable are defined; are taken when information about the system is confirmed as discoverable.

## Assessment Methods
