## Control Statement
Control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines requiring physical access controls are defined; within organizational facilities using security controls implemented to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines within the organizational facility are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Security controls applied to system distribution and transmission lines prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such controls may also be necessary to prevent eavesdropping or modification of unencrypted transmissions. Security controls used to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines include disconnected or locked spare jacks, locked wiring closets, protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays, and wiretapping sensors.

## Assessment Objectives
physical access to system distribution and transmission lines requiring physical access controls are defined; within organizational facilities is controlled using security controls implemented to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines within the organizational facility are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing access control for transmission mediums  system design documentation  facility communications and wiring diagrams  list of physical security safeguards applied to system distribution and transmission lines  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with physical access control responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for access control to distribution and transmission lines  mechanisms/security safeguards supporting and/or implementing access control to distribution and transmission lines
