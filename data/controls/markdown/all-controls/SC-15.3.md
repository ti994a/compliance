## Control Statement
Disable or remove collaborative computing devices and applications from systems or system components from which collaborative computing devices are disabled or removed are defined; in secure work areas where collaborative computing devices are disabled or removed from systems or system components are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Failing to disable or remove collaborative computing devices and applications from systems or system components can result in compromises of information, including eavesdropping on conversations. A Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) is an example of a secure work area.

## Assessment Objectives
collaborative computing devices and applications are disabled or removed from systems or system components from which collaborative computing devices are disabled or removed are defined; in secure work areas where collaborative computing devices are disabled or removed from systems or system components are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing collaborative computing  access control policy and procedures  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  list of secure work areas  systems or system components in secured work areas where collaborative computing devices are to be disabled or removed  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing collaborative computing devices Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the capability to disable collaborative computing devices
