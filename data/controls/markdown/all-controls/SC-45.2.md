Identify a secondary authoritative time source that is in a different geographic region than the primary authoritative time source; and Synchronize the internal system clocks to the secondary authoritative time source if the primary authoritative time source is unavailable.

## Implementation Guidance
It may be necessary to employ geolocation information to determine that the secondary authoritative time source is in a different geographic region.

## Assessment Objectives
a secondary authoritative time source is identified that is in a different geographic region than the primary authoritative time source; the internal system clocks are synchronized to the secondary authoritative time source if the primary authoritative time source is unavailable.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing time synchronization  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system time synchronization with secondary authoritative time sources
