## Control Statement
Based on circumstances that require information fragmentation are defined;: Fragment the following information: the information fragmented is defined; ; and Distribute the fragmented information across the following systems or system components: systems or system components across which the fragmented information is distributed are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
One objective of the advanced persistent threat is to exfiltrate valuable information. Once exfiltrated, there is generally no way for the organization to recover the lost information. Therefore, organizations may consider dividing the information into disparate elements and distributing those elements across multiple systems or system components and locations. Such actions will increase the adversary’s work factor to capture and exfiltrate the desired information and, in so doing, increase the probability of detection. The fragmentation of information impacts the organization’s ability to access the information in a timely manner. The extent of the fragmentation is dictated by the impact or classification level (and value) of the information, threat intelligence information received, and whether data tainting is used (i.e., data tainting-derived information about the exfiltration of some information could result in the fragmentation of the remaining information).

## Assessment Objectives
under circumstances that require information fragmentation are defined;, the information fragmented is defined; is fragmented; under circumstances that require information fragmentation are defined; , the fragmented information is distributed across systems or system components across which the fragmented information is distributed are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  personally identifiable information processing policy  procedures addressing software and information integrity  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  procedures to identify information for fragmentation and distribution across systems/system components  list of distributed and fragmented information  list of circumstances requiring information fragmentation  enterprise architecture  system security architecture  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  organizational personnel with systems security engineering responsibilities  system developers  security architects Organizational processes to identify information for fragmentation and distribution across systems/system components  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information fragmentation and distribution across systems/system components
