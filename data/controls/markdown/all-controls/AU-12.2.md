## Control Statement
Produce a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail composed of audit records in a standardized format.

## Implementation Guidance
Audit records that follow common standards promote interoperability and information exchange between devices and systems. Promoting interoperability and information exchange facilitates the production of event information that can be readily analyzed and correlated. If logging mechanisms do not conform to standardized formats, systems may convert individual audit records into standardized formats when compiling system-wide audit trails.

## Assessment Objectives
a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail composed of audit records is produced in a standardized format.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  system security plan  privacy plan  procedures addressing audit record generation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system-wide audit trail (logical or physical)  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with audit record generation responsibilities  organizational personnel with security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms implementing audit record generation capability
