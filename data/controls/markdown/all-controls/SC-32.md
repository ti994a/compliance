## Control Statement
Partition the system into system components to reside in separate physical or logical domains or environments based on circumstances for the physical or logical separation of components are defined; residing in separate physical domains or environments based on circumstances for the physical or logical separation of components are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
System partitioning is part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy. Organizations determine the degree of physical separation of system components. Physical separation options include physically distinct components in separate racks in the same room, critical components in separate rooms, and geographical separation of critical components. Security categorization can guide the selection of candidates for domain partitioning. Managed interfaces restrict or prohibit network access and information flow among partitioned system components.

## Assessment Objectives
the system is partitioned into system components to reside in separate physical or logical domains or environments based on circumstances for the physical or logical separation of components are defined; residing in separate physical domains or environments based on circumstances for the physical or logical separation of components are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing system partitioning  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  list of system physical domains (or environments)  system facility diagrams  system network diagrams  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  system developers/integrators Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the physical separation of system components
