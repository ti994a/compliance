## Control Statement
Implement the following measures to disassociate user attributes or identifier assertion relationships among individuals, credential service providers, and relying parties: disassociability measures are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Federated identity solutions can create increased privacy risks due to the tracking and profiling of individuals. Using identifier mapping tables or cryptographic techniques to blind credential service providers and relying parties from each other or to make identity attributes less visible to transmitting parties can reduce these privacy risks.

## Assessment Objectives
disassociability measures are defined; to disassociate user attributes or identifier assertion relationships among individuals, credential service providers, and relying parties are implemented.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  privacy plan  procedures addressing user identification and authentication  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system operations responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification and authentication capabilities
