## Control Statement
Protect the confidentiality of the following information at rest: information at rest requiring protection is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is not in process or in transit and is located on system components. Such components include internal or external hard disk drives, storage area network devices, or databases. However, the focus of protecting information at rest is not on the type of storage device or frequency of access but rather on the state of the information. Information at rest addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information and covers user information and system information. System-related information that requires protection includes configurations or rule sets for firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, filtering routers, and authentication information. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing write-once-read-many (WORM) technologies. When adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved, organizations may employ other controls, including frequent scanning to identify malicious code at rest and secure offline storage in lieu of online storage.

## Assessment Objectives
the confidentiality of information at rest requiring protection is defined; is/are protected.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing the protection of information at rest  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  cryptographic mechanisms and associated configuration documentation  list of information at rest requiring confidentiality and integrity protections  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing confidentiality and integrity protections for information at rest
