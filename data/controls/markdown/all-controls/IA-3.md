## Control Statement
Uniquely identify and authenticate devices and/or types of devices uniquely identified and authenticated before establishing a connection are defined; before establishing a local connection.

## Implementation Guidance
Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication are defined by type, device, or a combination of type and device. Organization-defined device types include devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems use shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and authenticate devices on local and wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms based on the security categories of systems and mission or business requirements. Because of the challenges of implementing device authentication on a large scale, organizations can restrict the application of the control to a limited number/type of devices based on mission or business needs.

## Assessment Objectives
devices and/or types of devices uniquely identified and authenticated before establishing a connection are defined; are uniquely identified and authenticated before establishing a local connection.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing device identification and authentication  system design documentation  list of devices requiring unique identification and authentication  device connection reports  system configuration settings and associated documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with operational responsibilities for device identification and authentication  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing device identification and authentication capabilities
