## Control Statement
Include components within organizational systems specifically designed to be the target of malicious attacks for detecting, deflecting, and analyzing such attacks.

## Implementation Guidance
Decoys (i.e., honeypots, honeynets, or deception nets) are established to attract adversaries and deflect attacks away from the operational systems that support organizational mission and business functions. Use of decoys requires some supporting isolation measures to ensure that any deflected malicious code does not infect organizational systems. Depending on the specific usage of the decoy, consultation with the Office of the General Counsel before deployment may be needed.

## Assessment Objectives
components within organizational systems specifically designed to be the target of malicious attacks are included to detect such attacks; components within organizational systems specifically designed to be the target of malicious attacks are included to deflect such attacks; components within organizational systems specifically designed to be the target of malicious attacks are included to analyze such attacks.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing the use of decoys  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing decoys
