## Control Statement
Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception at managed interfaces.

## Implementation Guidance
Denying by default and allowing by exception applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those system connections that are essential and approved are allowed. Deny by default, allow by exception also applies to a system that is connected to an external system.

## Assessment Objectives
network communications traffic is denied by default at managed interfaces; network communications traffic is allowed by exception at managed interfaces.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing boundary protection  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities Mechanisms implementing traffic management at managed interfaces
