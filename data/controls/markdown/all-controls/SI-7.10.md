## Control Statement
Implement the following mechanisms to protect the integrity of boot firmware in system components requiring mechanisms to protect the integrity of boot firmware are defined;: mechanisms implemented to protect the integrity of boot firmware in system components are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Unauthorized modifications to boot firmware may indicate a sophisticated, targeted attack. These types of targeted attacks can result in a permanent denial of service or a persistent malicious code presence. These situations can occur if the firmware is corrupted or if the malicious code is embedded within the firmware. System components can protect the integrity of boot firmware in organizational systems by verifying the integrity and authenticity of all updates to the firmware prior to applying changes to the system component and preventing unauthorized processes from modifying the boot firmware.

## Assessment Objectives
mechanisms implemented to protect the integrity of boot firmware in system components are defined; are implemented to protect the integrity of boot firmware in system components requiring mechanisms to protect the integrity of boot firmware are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing software, firmware, and information integrity  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  integrity verification tools and associated documentation  records of integrity verification scans  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for software, firmware, and/or information integrity  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Software, firmware, and information integrity verification tools  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing protection of the integrity of boot firmware  safeguards implementing protection of the integrity of boot firmware
