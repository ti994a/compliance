## Control Statement
Provide audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing as defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a) on system components that provide an audit record generation capability for the events types (defined in AU-02_ODP[02]) are defined;; Allow personnel or roles allowed to select the event types that are logged by specific components of the system to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system; and Generate audit records for the event types defined in [AU-2c](#au-2_smt.c) that include the audit record content defined in [AU-3](#au-3).

## Implementation Guidance
Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The event types specified in [AU-2d](#au-2_smt.d) are the event types for which audit logs are to be generated and are a subset of all event types for which the system can generate audit records.

## Assessment Objectives
audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing (defined in AU-02_ODP[01]) is provided by system components that provide an audit record generation capability for the events types (defined in AU-02_ODP[02]) are defined;; personnel or roles allowed to select the event types that are logged by specific components of the system is/are allowed to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system; audit records for the event types defined in AU-02_ODP[02] that include the audit record content defined in AU-03 are generated.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  procedures addressing audit record generation  system security plan  privacy plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of auditable events  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with audit record generation responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms implementing audit record generation capability
