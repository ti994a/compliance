## Control Statement
Employ automated mechanisms to maximize the effectiveness of sharing threat intelligence information.

## Implementation Guidance
To maximize the effectiveness of monitoring, it is important to know what threat observables and indicators the sensors need to be searching for. By using well-established frameworks, services, and automated tools, organizations improve their ability to rapidly share and feed the relevant threat detection signatures into monitoring tools.

## Assessment Objectives
automated mechanisms are employed to maximize the effectiveness of sharing threat intelligence information.

## Assessment Methods
Information security program plan  privacy program plan  threat awareness program policy  threat awareness program procedures  risk assessment results related to threat awareness  documentation about the cross-organization information-sharing capability  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities  organizational personnel responsible for the threat awareness program  organizational personnel responsible for the cross-organization information-sharing capability  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  external personnel with whom threat awareness information is shared by the organization Organizational processes for implementing the threat awareness program  organizational processes for implementing the cross-organization information-sharing capability  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the threat awareness program  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the cross-organization information-sharing capability
