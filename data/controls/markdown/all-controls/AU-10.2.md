## Control Statement
Validate the binding of the information producer identity to the information at the frequency at which to validate the binding of the information producer identity to the information is defined; ; and Perform the actions performed in the event of a validation error are defined; in the event of a validation error.

## Implementation Guidance
Validating the binding of the information producer identity to the information prevents the modification of information between production and review. The validation of bindings can be achieved by, for example, using cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine if validations are in response to user requests or generated automatically.

## Assessment Objectives
the binding of the information producer identity to the information is validated at the frequency at which to validate the binding of the information producer identity to the information is defined;; the actions performed in the event of a validation error are defined; in the event of a validation error are performed.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  system security plan  privacy plan  procedures addressing non-repudiation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  validation records  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms implementing non-repudiation capability
