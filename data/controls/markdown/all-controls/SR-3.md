## Control Statement
Establish a process or processes to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes of the system or system component requiring a process or processes to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies is defined; in coordination with supply chain personnel with whom to coordinate the process or processes to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes; Employ the following controls to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system component, or system service and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events: supply chain controls employed to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system component, or system service and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events are defined; ; and Document the selected and implemented supply chain processes and controls in security and privacy plans.

## Implementation Guidance
Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools employed for the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes include hardware, software, and firmware development processes; shipping and handling procedures; personnel security and physical security programs; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain elements and processes may be provided by organizations, system integrators, or external providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to cause harm to the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or business functions. Supply chain personnel are individuals with roles and responsibilities in the supply chain.

## Assessment Objectives
a process or processes is/are established to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes of the system or system component requiring a process or processes to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies is defined;; the process or processes to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes of the system or system component requiring a process or processes to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies is defined; is/are coordinated with supply chain personnel with whom to coordinate the process or processes to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes; supply chain controls employed to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system component, or system service and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events are defined; are employed to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system component, or system service and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events; the selected and implemented supply chain processes and controls are documented in security and privacy plans.

## Assessment Methods
Supply chain risk management policy  supply chain risk management procedures  supply chain risk management strategy  supply chain risk management plan  systems and critical system components inventory documentation  system and services acquisition policy  system and services acquisition procedures  procedures addressing the integration of information security and privacy requirements into the acquisition process  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation (including purchase orders)  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for systems or services  risk register documentation  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities Organizational processes for identifying and addressing supply chain element and process deficiencies
