## Control Statement
Implement non-persistent non-persistent system components and services implemented are defined; that are initiated in a known state and terminated upon end of session of use.

## Implementation Guidance
Implementation of non-persistent components and services mitigates risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate and complete attacks. By implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected system components, organizations can provide a trusted, known state computing resource for a specific time period that does not give adversaries sufficient time to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems or operating environments. Since the APT is a high-end, sophisticated threat with regard to capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period, a percentage of attacks will be successful. Non-persistent system components and services are activated as required using protected information and terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of adversaries attempting to compromise or breach organizational systems.  Non-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components, periodically reimaging components, or using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can be implemented by using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent). The benefit of periodic refreshes of system components and services is that it does not require organizations to first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks, but not with such frequency that it makes the system unstable. Refreshes of critical components and services may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities.

## Assessment Objectives
non-persistent non-persistent system components and services implemented are defined; that are initiated in a known state are implemented; non-persistent non-persistent system components and services implemented are defined; are terminated upon end of session of use.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing non-persistence for system components  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for non-persistence  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the initiation and termination of non-persistent components
