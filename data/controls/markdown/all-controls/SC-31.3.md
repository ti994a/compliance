## Control Statement
Measure the bandwidth of subset of identified covert channels whose bandwidth is measured in the operational environment of the system is defined; in the operational environment of the system.

## Implementation Guidance
Measuring covert channel bandwidth in specified operational environments helps organizations determine how much information can be covertly leaked before such leakage adversely affects mission or business functions. Covert channel bandwidth may be significantly different when measured in settings that are independent of the specific environments of operation, including laboratories or system development environments.

## Assessment Objectives
the bandwidth of subset of identified covert channels whose bandwidth is measured in the operational environment of the system is defined; is measured in the operational environment of the system.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing covert channel analysis  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  covert channel analysis documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with covert channel analysis responsibilities  system developers/integrators Organizational process for conducting covert channel analysis  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing covert channel analysis  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the capability to measure the bandwidth of covert channels
