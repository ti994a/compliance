## Control Statement
Generate error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without revealing information that could be exploited; and Reveal error messages only to personnel or roles to whom error messages are revealed.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations consider the structure and content of error messages. The extent to which systems can handle error conditions is guided and informed by organizational policy and operational requirements. Exploitable information includes stack traces and implementation details; erroneous logon attempts with passwords mistakenly entered as the username; mission or business information that can be derived from, if not stated explicitly by, the information recorded; and personally identifiable information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers. Error messages may also provide a covert channel for transmitting information.

## Assessment Objectives
error messages that provide the information necessary for corrective actions are generated without revealing information that could be exploited; error messages are revealed only to personnel or roles to whom error messages are revealed.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing system error handling  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  documentation providing the structure and content of error messages  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for information input validation  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Organizational processes for error handling  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing error handling  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the management of error messages
