## Control Statement
Verify session and network connection termination after the completion of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.

## Implementation Guidance
Verifying the termination of a connection once maintenance is completed ensures that connections established during nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions have been terminated and are no longer available for use.

## Assessment Objectives
session connection termination is verified after the completion of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions; network connection termination is verified after the completion of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.

## Assessment Methods
Maintenance policy  procedures addressing nonlocal system maintenance  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  session/network termination logs  cryptographic mechanisms protecting nonlocal maintenance activities  maintenance records  diagnostic records  audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system maintenance responsibilities  network engineers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Mechanisms implementing remote disconnect verifications of terminated nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions
