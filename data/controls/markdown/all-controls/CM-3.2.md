## Control Statement
Test, validate, and document changes to the system before finalizing the implementation of the changes.

## Implementation Guidance
Changes to systems include modifications to hardware, software, or firmware components and configuration settings defined in [CM-6](#cm-6) . Organizations ensure that testing does not interfere with system operations that support organizational mission and business functions. Individuals or groups conducting tests understand security and privacy policies and procedures, system security and privacy policies and procedures, and the health, safety, and environmental risks associated with specific facilities or processes. Operational systems may need to be taken offline, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If systems must be taken offline for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages whenever possible. If the testing cannot be conducted on operational systems, organizations employ compensating controls.

## Assessment Objectives
changes to the system are tested before finalizing the implementation of the changes; changes to the system are validated before finalizing the implementation of the changes; changes to the system are documented before finalizing the implementation of the changes.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  configuration management plan  procedures addressing system configuration change control  system design documentation  system architecture and configuration documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  test records  validation records  change control records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with configuration change control responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers  members of change control board or similar Organizational processes for configuration change control  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing, testing, validating, and documenting system changes
