## Control Statement
Support the tracking of system components by geographic location using automated mechanisms for tracking components are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The use of automated mechanisms to track the location of system components can increase the accuracy of component inventories. Such capability may help organizations rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of system components that have been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions. The use of tracking mechanisms can be coordinated with senior agency officials for privacy if there are implications that affect individual privacy.

## Assessment Objectives
automated mechanisms for tracking components are defined; are used to support the tracking of system components by geographic location.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing system component inventory  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system component inventory  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with component inventory management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Organizational processes for managing the system component inventory  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system component inventory  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing tracking of components by geographic locations
