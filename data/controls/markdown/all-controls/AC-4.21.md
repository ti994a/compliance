## Control Statement
Separate information flows logically or physically using organization-defined mechanisms and/or techniques to accomplish required separations by types of information are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Enforcing the separation of information flows associated with defined types of data can enhance protection by ensuring that information is not commingled while in transit and by enabling flow control by transmission paths that are not otherwise achievable. Types of separable information include inbound and outbound communications traffic, service requests and responses, and information of differing security impact or classification levels.

## Assessment Objectives
information flows are separated logically using mechanisms and/or techniques used to logically separate information flows are defined (if selected); to accomplish required separations by types of information are defined;; information flows are separated physically using mechanisms and/or techniques used to physically separate information flows are defined (if selected); to accomplish required separations by types of information are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Information flow enforcement policy  information flow control policies  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of required separation of information flows by information types  list of mechanisms and/or techniques used to logically or physically separate information flows  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information flow enforcement responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement functions
