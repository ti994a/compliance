## Control Statement
Implement mechanisms implemented to authenticate remote commands are defined; to authenticate remote commands authenticated by mechanisms are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Authenticating remote commands protects against unauthorized commands and the replay of authorized commands. The ability to authenticate remote commands is important for remote systems for which loss, malfunction, misdirection, or exploitation would have immediate or serious consequences, such as injury, death, property damage, loss of high value assets, failure of mission or business functions, or compromise of classified or controlled unclassified information. Authentication mechanisms for remote commands ensure that systems accept and execute commands in the order intended, execute only authorized commands, and reject unauthorized commands. Cryptographic mechanisms can be used, for example, to authenticate remote commands.

## Assessment Objectives
mechanisms implemented to authenticate remote commands are defined; are implemented to authenticate remote commands authenticated by mechanisms are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing authentication of remote commands  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing authentication of remote commands
