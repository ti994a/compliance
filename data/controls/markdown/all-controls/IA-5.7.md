## Control Statement
Ensure that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or other forms of static storage.

## Implementation Guidance
In addition to applications, other forms of static storage include access scripts and function keys. Organizations exercise caution when determining whether embedded or stored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the manner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators.

## Assessment Objectives
unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or other forms of static storage.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing authenticator management  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  logical access scripts  application code reviews for detecting unencrypted static authenticators  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with authenticator management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing authenticator management capability  mechanisms implementing authentication in applications
