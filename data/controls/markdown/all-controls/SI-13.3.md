## Control Statement
Manually initiate transfers between active and standby system components when the use of the active component reaches the percentage of the mean time to failure for transfers manually initiated is defined; of the mean time to failure.

## Implementation Guidance
For example, if the MTTF for a system component is 100 days and the MTTF percentage defined by the organization is 90 percent, the manual transfer would occur after 90 days.

## Assessment Objectives
transfers are initiated manually between active and standby system components when the use of the active component reaches the percentage of the mean time to failure for transfers manually initiated is defined; of the mean time to failure.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing predictable failure prevention  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for MTTF activities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with contingency planning responsibilities Organizational processes for managing MTTF and conducting the manual transfer between active and standby components
