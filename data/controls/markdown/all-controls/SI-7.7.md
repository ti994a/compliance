Maintaining historical records is important for being able to identify and discern adversary actions over an extended time period and for possible legal actions. Security-relevant changes include unauthorized changes to established configuration settings or the unauthorized elevation of system privileges.

## Assessment Objectives
the detection of security-relevant changes to the system are defined; are incorporated into the organizational incident response capability.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing software, firmware, and information integrity  procedures addressing incident response  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  incident response records  audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for software, firmware, and/or information integrity  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with incident response responsibilities Organizational processes for incorporating the detection of unauthorized security-relevant changes into the incident response capability  software, firmware, and information integrity verification tools  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the incorporation of detection of unauthorized security-relevant changes into the incident response capability
