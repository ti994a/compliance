## Control Statement
Employ system components employed with no writeable storage are defined; with no writeable storage that is persistent across component restart or power on/off.

## Implementation Guidance
Disallowing writeable storage eliminates the possibility of malicious code insertion via persistent, writeable storage within the designated system components. The restriction applies to fixed and removable storage, with the latter being addressed either directly or as specific restrictions imposed through access controls for mobile devices.

## Assessment Objectives
system components employed with no writeable storage are defined; are employed with no writeable storage that is persistent across component restart or power on/off.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing non-modifiable executable programs  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  list of system components to be employed without writeable storage capabilities  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  system developers/integrators Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the employment of components with no writeable storage  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing persistent non-writeable storage across component restart and power on/off
