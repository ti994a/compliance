## Control Statement
Limit the use of commercially provided information assurance and information assurance-enabled information technology products to those products that have been successfully evaluated against a National Information Assurance partnership (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile for a specific technology type, if such a profile exists; and Require, if no NIAP-approved Protection Profile exists for a specific technology type but a commercially provided information technology product relies on cryptographic functionality to enforce its security policy, that the cryptographic module is FIPS-validated or NSA-approved.

## Implementation Guidance
See [NIAP CCEVS](#795aff72-3e6c-4b6b-a80a-b14d84b7f544) for additional information on NIAP. See [NIST CMVP](#1acdc775-aafb-4d11-9341-dc6a822e9d38) for additional information on FIPS-validated cryptographic modules.

## Assessment Objectives
the use of commercially provided information assurance and information assurance-enabled information technology products is limited to those products that have been successfully evaluated against a National Information Assurance partnership (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile for a specific technology type, if such a profile exists; if no NIAP-approved Protection Profile exists for a specific technology type but a commercially provided information technology product relies on cryptographic functionality to enforce its security policy, that cryptographic module is required to be FIPS-validated or NSA-approved.

## Assessment Methods
Supply chain risk management plan  system and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the integration of security requirements, descriptions, and criteria into the acquisition process  solicitation documents  acquisition documentation  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  list of deployed IT products/solutions  NAIP-approved protection profiles  FIPS-validation information for cryptographic functionality  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting responsibilities  organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security requirements  organizational personnel responsible for ensuring that information assurance products have been evaluated against a NIAP-approved protection profile or for ensuring products relying on cryptographic functionality are FIPS-validated  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for selecting and employing products/services evaluated against a NIAP-approved protection profile or FIPS-validated products
