## Control Statement
Provide an uninterruptible power supply to facilitate an orderly shutdown of the system in the event of a primary power source loss.

## Implementation Guidance
An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical system or mechanism that provides emergency power when there is a failure of the main power source. A UPS is typically used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious mission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly shut down the system.

## Assessment Objectives
an uninterruptible power supply is provided to facilitate an orderly shutdown of the system in the event of a primary power source loss.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing emergency power  uninterruptible power supply  uninterruptible power supply documentation  uninterruptible power supply test records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for emergency power and/or planning  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing an uninterruptible power supply  the uninterruptable power supply
