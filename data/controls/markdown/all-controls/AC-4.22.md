## Control Statement
Provide access from a single device to computing platforms, applications, or data residing in multiple different security domains, while preventing information flow between the different security domains.

## Implementation Guidance
The system provides a capability for users to access each connected security domain without providing any mechanisms to allow users to transfer data or information between the different security domains. An example of an access-only solution is a terminal that provides a user access to information with different security classifications while assuredly keeping the information separate.

## Assessment Objectives
access is provided from a single device to computing platforms, applications, or data that reside in multiple different security domains while preventing information flow between the different security domains.

## Assessment Methods
Information flow enforcement policy  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information flow enforcement responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement functions
