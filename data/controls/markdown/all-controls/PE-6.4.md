## Control Statement
Monitor physical access to the system in addition to the physical access monitoring of the facility at physical spaces containing one or more components of the system are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Monitoring physical access to systems provides additional monitoring for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components, including server rooms, media storage areas, and communications centers. Physical access monitoring can be coordinated with intrusion detection systems and system monitoring capabilities to provide comprehensive and integrated threat coverage for the organization.

## Assessment Objectives
physical access to the system is monitored in addition to the physical access monitoring of the facility at physical spaces containing one or more components of the system are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing physical access monitoring  physical access control logs or records  physical access control devices  access authorizations  access credentials  list of areas within the facility containing concentrations of system components or system components requiring additional physical access monitoring  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with physical access monitoring responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Organizational processes for monitoring physical access to the system  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical access monitoring for facility areas containing system components
