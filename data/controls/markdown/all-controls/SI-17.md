Implement the indicated fail-safe procedures when the indicated failures occur: organization-defined list of failure conditions and associated fail-safe procedures.

## Implementation Guidance
Failure conditions include the loss of communications among critical system components or between system components and operational facilities. Fail-safe procedures include alerting operator personnel and providing specific instructions on subsequent steps to take. Subsequent steps may include doing nothing, reestablishing system settings, shutting down processes, restarting the system, or contacting designated organizational personnel.

## Assessment Objectives
fail-safe procedures associated with failure conditions are defined; are implemented when a list of failure conditions requiring fail-safe procedures is defined; occur.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  documentation addressing fail-safe procedures for the system  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of security safeguards protecting the system memory from unauthorized code execution  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for fail-safe procedures  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Organizational fail-safe procedures  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing fail-safe procedures
