## Control Statement
Use qualitative and quantitative data from testing to: Determine the effectiveness of incident response processes; Continuously improve incident response processes; and Provide incident response measures and metrics that are accurate, consistent, and in a reproducible format.

## Implementation Guidance
To help incident response activities function as intended, organizations may use metrics and evaluation criteria to assess incident response programs as part of an effort to continually improve response performance. These efforts facilitate improvement in incident response efficacy and lessen the impact of incidents.

## Assessment Objectives
qualitative data from testing are used to determine the effectiveness of incident response processes; quantitative data from testing are used to determine the effectiveness of incident response processes; qualitative data from testing are used to continuously improve incident response processes; quantitative data from testing are used to continuously improve incident response processes; qualitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics that are accurate; quantitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics that are accurate; qualitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics that are consistent; quantitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics that are consistent; qualitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics in a reproducible format; quantitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics in a reproducible format.
