## Control Statement
Identify and document duties of individuals requiring separation are defined; ; and Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

## Implementation Guidance
Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission or business functions and support functions among different individuals or roles, conducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring that security personnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety of systems and system components when developing policy on separation of duties. Separation of duties is enforced through the account management activities in [AC-2](#ac-2) , access control mechanisms in [AC-3](#ac-3) , and identity management activities in [IA-2](#ia-2), [IA-4](#ia-4) , and [IA-12](#ia-12).

## Assessment Objectives
duties of individuals requiring separation are defined; are identified and documented; system access authorizations to support separation of duties are defined.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing divisions of responsibility and separation of duties  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of divisions of responsibility and separation of duties  system access authorizations  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining appropriate divisions of responsibility and separation of duties  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Mechanisms implementing separation of duties policy
