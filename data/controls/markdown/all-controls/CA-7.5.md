## Control Statement
Employ the following actions to validate that policies are established and implemented controls are operating in a consistent manner: organization-defined actions.

## Implementation Guidance
Security and privacy controls are often added incrementally to a system. As a result, policies for selecting and implementing controls may be inconsistent, and the controls could fail to work together in a consistent or coordinated manner. At a minimum, the lack of consistency and coordination could mean that there are unacceptable security and privacy gaps in the system. At worst, it could mean that some of the controls implemented in one location or by one component are actually impeding the functionality of other controls (e.g., encrypting internal network traffic can impede monitoring). In other situations, failing to consistently monitor all implemented network protocols (e.g., a dual stack of IPv4 and IPv6) may create unintended vulnerabilities in the system that could be exploited by adversaries. It is important to validate—through testing, monitoring, and analysis—that the implemented controls are operating in a consistent, coordinated, non-interfering manner.

## Assessment Objectives
actions to validate that policies are established are defined; are employed to validate that policies are established; actions to validate that implemented controls are operating in a consistent manner are defined; are employed to validate that implemented controls are operating in a consistent manner.

## Assessment Methods
Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy  organizational continuous monitoring strategy  system-level continuous monitoring strategy  procedures addressing continuous monitoring of system security controls  assessment report  plan of action and milestones  system monitoring records  security impact analyses  status reports  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with continuous monitoring responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Mechanisms supporting consistency analyses
