## Control Statement
When transferring information between different security domains, implement a linear content filter pipeline that is enforced with discretionary and mandatory access controls.

## Implementation Guidance
Content filtering is the process of inspecting information as it traverses a cross-domain solution and determines if the information meets a predefined policy. The use of linear content filter pipelines ensures that filter processes are non-bypassable and always invoked. In general, the use of parallel filtering architectures for content filtering of a single data type introduces bypass and non-invocation issues.

## Assessment Objectives
when transferring information between security domains, a linear content filter pipeline is implemented that is enforced with discretionary and mandatory access controls.

## Assessment Methods
Information flow enforcement policy  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information flow enforcement responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement functions  mechanisms implementing linear content filters
