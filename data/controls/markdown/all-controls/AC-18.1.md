## Control Statement
Protect wireless access to the system using authentication of users and encryption.

## Implementation Guidance
Wireless networking capabilities represent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. To protect systems with wireless access points, strong authentication of users and devices along with strong encryption can reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.

## Assessment Objectives
wireless access to the system is protected using authentication of users; wireless access to the system is protected using encryption.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing wireless implementation and usage (including restrictions)  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing wireless access protections to the system
