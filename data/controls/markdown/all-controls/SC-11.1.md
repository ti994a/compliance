## Control Statement
Provide a trusted communications path that is irrefutably distinguishable from other communications paths; and Initiate the trusted communications path for communications between the security functions of the system are defined; of the system and the user.

## Implementation Guidance
An irrefutable communications path permits the system to initiate a trusted path, which necessitates that the user can unmistakably recognize the source of the communication as a trusted system component. For example, the trusted path may appear in an area of the display that other applications cannot access or be based on the presence of an identifier that cannot be spoofed.

## Assessment Objectives
a trusted communication path that is irrefutably distinguishable from other communication paths is provided; the trusted communication path for communications between the security functions of the system are defined; of the system and the user is initiated.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing trusted communication paths  security plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  assessment results from independent, testing organizations  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing trusted communication paths
