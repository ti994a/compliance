## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of minimized security elements in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of minimized security elements are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of minimized security elements states that the system does not have extraneous trusted components. The principle of minimized security elements has two aspects: the overall cost of security analysis and the complexity of security analysis. Trusted components are generally costlier to construct and implement, owing to the increased rigor of development processes. Trusted components require greater security analysis to qualify their trustworthiness. Thus, to reduce the cost and decrease the complexity of the security analysis, a system contains as few trustworthy components as possible. The analysis of the interaction of trusted components with other components of the system is one of the most important aspects of system security verification. If the interactions between components are unnecessarily complex, the security of the system will also be more difficult to ascertain than one whose internal trust relationships are simple and elegantly constructed. In general, fewer trusted components result in fewer internal trust relationships and a simpler system.

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of minimized security elements are defined; implement the security design principle of minimized security elements.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the security design principle of minimized security elements used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of minimized security elements in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of minimized security elements in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification
