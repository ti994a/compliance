## Control Statement
Employ presentation attack detection mechanisms for biometric-based authentication.

## Implementation Guidance
Biometric characteristics do not constitute secrets. Such characteristics can be obtained by online web accesses, taking a picture of someone with a camera phone to obtain facial images with or without their knowledge, lifting from objects that someone has touched (e.g., a latent fingerprint), or capturing a high-resolution image (e.g., an iris pattern). Presentation attack detection technologies including liveness detection, can mitigate the risk of these types of attacks by making it difficult to produce artifacts intended to defeat the biometric sensor.

## Assessment Objectives
presentation attack detection mechanisms are employed for biometric-based authentication.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  procedures addressing identifier management  system security plan  system design documentation  mechanisms providing dynamic binding of identifiers and authenticators  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with identification and authentication management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing account management capability  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification and authentication management capabilities for the system
