## Control Statement
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate the following software or firmware components prior to installation: software or firmware components authenticated by cryptographic mechanisms prior to installation are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Cryptographic authentication includes verifying that software or firmware components have been digitally signed using certificates recognized and approved by organizations. Code signing is an effective method to protect against malicious code. Organizations that employ cryptographic mechanisms also consider cryptographic key management solutions.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to authenticate software or firmware components authenticated by cryptographic mechanisms prior to installation are defined; prior to installation.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing software, firmware, and information integrity  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  cryptographic mechanisms and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for software, firmware, and/or information integrity  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Cryptographic mechanisms authenticating software and firmware prior to installation
