## Control Statement
Allow the use of authentication factors allowed used that are different from the primary authentication factors are defined; that are different from the primary authentication factors after the number of organization-defined consecutive invalid logon attempts have been exceeded; and Enforce a limit of the number of consecutive, invalid logon attempts through the use of alternative factors for which to enforce a limit by a user is defined; consecutive invalid logon attempts through use of the alternative factors by a user during a time period during which a user can attempt logons through alternative factors is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The use of alternate authentication factors supports the objective of availability and allows a user who has inadvertently been locked out to use additional authentication factors to bypass the lockout.

## Assessment Objectives
authentication factors allowed used that are different from the primary authentication factors are defined; that are different from the primary authentication factors are allowed to be used after the number of organization-defined consecutive invalid logon attempts have been exceeded; a limit of the number of consecutive, invalid logon attempts through the use of alternative factors for which to enforce a limit by a user is defined; consecutive invalid logon attempts through the use of the alternative factors by the user during a time period during which a user can attempt logons through alternative factors is defined; is enforced.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing unsuccessful logon attempts for primary and alternate authentication factors  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing access control policy for unsuccessful logon attempts
