## Control Statement
Correlate the output from vulnerability scanning tools to determine the presence of multi-vulnerability and multi-hop attack vectors.

## Implementation Guidance
An attack vector is a path or means by which an adversary can gain access to a system in order to deliver malicious code or exfiltrate information. Organizations can use attack trees to show how hostile activities by adversaries interact and combine to produce adverse impacts or negative consequences to systems and organizations. Such information, together with correlated data from vulnerability scanning tools, can provide greater clarity regarding multi-vulnerability and multi-hop attack vectors. The correlation of vulnerability scanning information is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). During such transitions, some system components may inadvertently be unmanaged and create opportunities for adversary exploitation.

## Assessment Objectives
the output from vulnerability scanning tools is correlated to determine the presence of multi-vulnerability and multi-hop attack vectors.

## Assessment Methods
Risk assessment policy  procedures addressing vulnerability scanning  risk assessment  vulnerability scanning tools and techniques documentation  vulnerability scanning results  vulnerability management records  audit records  event/vulnerability correlation logs  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning responsibilities  organizational personnel with vulnerability scan analysis responsibilities  organizational personnel with security responsibilities Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning  mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing vulnerability scanning  mechanisms implementing the correlation of vulnerability scan results
