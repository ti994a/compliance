## Control Statement
physically disable or remove connection ports or input/output devices disabled or removed are defined; on the following systems or system components: systems or system components with connection ports or input/output devices disabled or removed are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Connection ports include Universal Serial Bus (USB), Thunderbolt, and Firewire (IEEE 1394). Input/output (I/O) devices include compact disc and digital versatile disc drives. Disabling or removing such connection ports and I/O devices helps prevent the exfiltration of information from systems and the introduction of malicious code from those ports or devices. Physically disabling or removing ports and/or devices is the stronger action.

## Assessment Objectives
connection ports or input/output devices disabled or removed are defined; are physically disabled or removed on systems or system components with connection ports or input/output devices disabled or removed are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  access control policy and procedures  procedures addressing port and input/output device access  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  systems or system components  list of connection ports or input/output devices to be physically disabled or removed on systems or system components  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the disabling of connection ports or input/output devices
