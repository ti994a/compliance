## Control Statement
Determine mean time to failure (MTTF) for the following system components in specific environments of operation: system components for which mean time to failure (MTTF) should be determined are defined; ; and Provide substitute system components and a means to exchange active and standby components in accordance with the following criteria: mean time to failure (MTTF) substitution criteria used as a means to exchange active and standby components are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, predictable failure prevention is intended to address potential failures of system components that provide security capabilities. Failure rates reflect installation-specific consideration rather than the industry-average. Organizations define the criteria for the substitution of system components based on the MTTF value with consideration for the potential harm from component failures. The transfer of responsibilities between active and standby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capabilities. The preservation of system state variables is also critical to help ensure a successful transfer process. Standby components remain available at all times except for maintenance issues or recovery failures in progress.

## Assessment Objectives
mean time to failure (MTTF) is determined for system components for which mean time to failure (MTTF) should be determined are defined; in specific environments of operation; substitute system components and a means to exchange active and standby components are provided in accordance with mean time to failure (MTTF) substitution criteria used as a means to exchange active and standby components are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing predictable failure prevention  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of MTTF substitution criteria  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for MTTF determinations and activities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with contingency planning responsibilities Organizational processes for managing MTTF
