## Control Statement
Establish and maintain unique identification of the following supply chain elements, processes, and personnel associated with the identified system and critical system components: supply chain elements, processes, and personnel associated with systems and critical system components that require unique identification are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is critical to gaining visibility into supply chain activities. Visibility into supply chain activities is also important for monitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable visibility into supply chains elements, processes, and personnel, it is very difficult for organizations to understand and manage risk and reduce their susceptibility to adverse events. Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools used for the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes include development processes for hardware, software, and firmware; shipping and handling procedures; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; personnel and physical security programs; or other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the production and distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain personnel are individuals with specific roles and responsibilities related to the secure the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of a system or system component. Identification methods are sufficient to support an investigation in case of a supply chain change (e.g. if a supply company is purchased), compromise, or event.

## Assessment Objectives
unique identification of supply chain elements, processes, and personnel associated with systems and critical system components that require unique identification are defined; is established; unique identification of supply chain elements, processes, and personnel associated with systems and critical system components that require unique identification are defined; is maintained.

## Assessment Methods
Supply chain risk management policy and procedures  supply chain risk management plan  system and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing supply chain protection  procedures addressing the integration of information security requirements into the acquisition process  list of supply chain elements, processes, and actors (associated with the system, system component, or system service) requiring implementation of unique identification processes, procedures, tools, mechanisms, equipment, techniques, and/or configurations  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and services acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with supply chain protection responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibilities for establishing and retaining the unique identification of supply chain elements, processes, and actors Organizational processes for defining, establishing, and retaining unique identification for supply chain elements, processes, and actors  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the definition, establishment, and retention of unique identification for supply chain elements, processes, and actors
