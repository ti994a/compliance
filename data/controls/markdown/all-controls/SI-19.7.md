# SI-19.7: Validated Algorithms and Software

**Family:** System and Information Integrity

## Control Statement
Perform de-identification using validated algorithms and software that is validated to implement the algorithms.

## Implementation Guidance
Algorithms that appear to remove personally identifiable information from a dataset may in fact leave information that is personally identifiable or data that is re-identifiable. Software that is claimed to implement a validated algorithm may contain bugs or implement a different algorithm. Software may de-identify one type of data, such as integers, but not de-identify another type of data, such as floating point numbers. For these reasons, de-identification is performed using algorithms and software that are validated.

## Assessment Objectives
de-identification is performed using validated algorithms; de-identification is performed using software that is validated to implement the algorithms.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  personally identifiable information processing policy  de-identification procedures  system configuration  de-identified datasets  algorithm and software validation tools  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for de-identifying the dataset  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Validated algorithms and software
