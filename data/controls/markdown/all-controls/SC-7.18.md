## Control Statement
Prevent systems from entering unsecure states in the event of an operational failure of a boundary protection device.

## Implementation Guidance
Fail secure is a condition achieved by employing mechanisms to ensure that in the event of operational failures of boundary protection devices at managed interfaces, systems do not enter into unsecure states where intended security properties no longer hold. Managed interfaces include routers, firewalls, and application gateways that reside on protected subnetworks (commonly referred to as demilitarized zones). Failures of boundary protection devices cannot lead to or cause information external to the devices to enter the devices nor can failures permit unauthorized information releases.

## Assessment Objectives
systems are prevented from entering unsecure states in the event of an operational failure of a boundary protection device.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing boundary protection  system design documentation  system architecture  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing secure failure
