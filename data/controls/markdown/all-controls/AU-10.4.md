## Control Statement
Validate the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information at the transfer or release points prior to release or transfer between security domains for which the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information is validated at transfer or release are defined; ; and Perform actions performed in the event of a validation error are defined; in the event of a validation error.

## Implementation Guidance
Validating the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information at transfer or release points prevents the unauthorized modification of information between review and the transfer or release. The validation of bindings can be achieved by using cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine if validations are in response to user requests or generated automatically.

## Assessment Objectives
the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information at the transfer or release points prior to release or transfer between security domains for which the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information is validated at transfer or release are defined; is validated; actions performed in the event of a validation error are defined; are performed in the event of a validation error.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  system security plan  privacy plan  procedures addressing non-repudiation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  validation records  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms implementing non-repudiation capability
