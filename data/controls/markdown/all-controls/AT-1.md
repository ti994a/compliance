## Control Statement
Develop, document, and disseminate to organization-defined personnel or roles: organization-level awareness and training policy that: Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the awareness and training policy and the associated awareness and training controls; Designate an an official to manage the awareness and training policy and procedures is defined; to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the awareness and training policy and procedures; and Review and update the current awareness and training: Policy the frequency at which the current awareness and training policy is reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require the current awareness and training policy reviewed and updated are defined; ; and Procedures the frequency at which the current awareness and training procedures are reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Awareness and training policy and procedures address the controls in the AT family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of awareness and training policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to awareness and training policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Assessment Objectives
an awareness and training policy is developed and documented;  the awareness and training policy is disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the awareness and training policy is disseminated; awareness and training procedures to facilitate the implementation of the awareness and training policy and associated access controls are developed and documented; the awareness and training procedures are disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the awareness and training procedures are disseminated. the organization-level awareness and training policy addresses purpose; the organization-level awareness and training policy addresses scope; the organization-level awareness and training policy addresses roles; the organization-level awareness and training policy addresses responsibilities; the organization-level awareness and training policy addresses management commitment; the organization-level awareness and training policy addresses coordination among organizational entities; the organization-level awareness and training policy addresses compliance; and the organization-level awareness and training policy is consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and the an official to manage the awareness and training policy and procedures is defined; is designated to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the awareness and training policy and procedures; the current awareness and training policy is reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current awareness and training policy is reviewed and updated is defined;;  the current awareness and training policy is reviewed and updated following events that would require the current awareness and training policy reviewed and updated are defined;; the current awareness and training procedures are reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current awareness and training procedures are reviewed and updated is defined;; the current awareness and training procedures are reviewed and updated following events that would require procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.
