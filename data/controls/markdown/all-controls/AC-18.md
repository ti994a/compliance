## Control Statement
Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of wireless access; and Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to allowing such connections.

## Implementation Guidance
Wireless technologies include microwave, packet radio (ultra-high frequency or very high frequency), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that provide authenticator protection and mutual authentication.

## Assessment Objectives
configuration requirements are established for each type of wireless access; connection requirements are established for each type of wireless access; implementation guidance is established for each type of wireless access; each type of wireless access to the system is authorized prior to allowing such connections.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing wireless access implementation and usage (including restrictions)  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  wireless access authorizations  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing wireless access connections  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Wireless access management capability for the system
