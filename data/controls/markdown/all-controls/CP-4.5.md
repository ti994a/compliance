## Control Statement
Employ mechanisms employed to disrupt and adversely affect the system or system component are defined; to system or system component on which to apply disruption mechanisms are defined; to disrupt and adversely affect the system or system component.

## Implementation Guidance
Often, the best method of assessing system resilience is to disrupt the system in some manner. The mechanisms used by the organization could disrupt system functions or system services in many ways, including terminating or disabling critical system components, changing the configuration of system components, degrading critical functionality (e.g., restricting network bandwidth), or altering privileges. Automated, on-going, and simulated cyber-attacks and service disruptions can reveal unexpected functional dependencies and help the organization determine its ability to ensure resilience in the face of an actual cyber-attack.

## Assessment Objectives
mechanisms employed to disrupt and adversely affect the system or system component are defined; are employed to disrupt and adversely affect the system or system component on which to apply disruption mechanisms are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Contingency planning policy  procedures addressing system recovery and reconstitution  contingency plan  contingency plan test documentation  contingency plan test results  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with contingency plan testing responsibilities  organizational personnel with system recovery and reconstitution responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for contingency plan testing  mechanisms supporting contingency plan testing
