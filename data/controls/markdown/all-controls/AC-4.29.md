## Control Statement
When transferring information between different security domains, employ content filter orchestration engines to ensure that: Content filtering mechanisms successfully complete execution without errors; and Content filtering actions occur in the correct order and comply with policy for content-filtering actions is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Content filtering is the process of inspecting information as it traverses a cross-domain solution and determines if the information meets a predefined security policy. An orchestration engine coordinates the sequencing of activities (manual and automated) in a content filtering process. Errors are defined as either anomalous actions or unexpected termination of the content filter process. This is not the same as a filter failing content due to non-compliance with policy. Content filter reports are a commonly used mechanism to ensure that expected filtering actions are completed successfully.

## Assessment Objectives
when transferring information between security domains, content filter orchestration engines are employed to ensure that content-filtering mechanisms successfully complete execution without errors; when transferring information between security domains, content filter orchestration engines are employed to ensure that content-filtering actions occur in the correct order; when transferring information between security domains, content filter orchestration engines are employed to ensure that content-filtering actions comply with policy for content-filtering actions is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Information flow enforcement policy  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information flow enforcement responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement functions  mechanisms implementing content filter orchestration engines
