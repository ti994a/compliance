## Control Statement
Restrict the use of information inputs to trusted sources to which the use of information inputs is restricted are defined; and/or formats to which the use of information inputs is restricted are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Restricting the use of inputs to trusted sources and in trusted formats applies the concept of authorized or permitted software to information inputs. Specifying known trusted sources for information inputs and acceptable formats for such inputs can reduce the probability of malicious activity. The information inputs are those defined by the organization in the base control ( [SI-10](#si-10)).

## Assessment Objectives
the use of information inputs is restricted to trusted sources to which the use of information inputs is restricted are defined; and/or formats to which the use of information inputs is restricted are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing information input validation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of trusted sources for information inputs  list of acceptable formats for input restrictions  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for information input validation  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Organizational processes for restricting information inputs  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing restriction of information inputs
