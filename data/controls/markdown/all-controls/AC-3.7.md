## Control Statement
Enforce a role-based access control policy over defined subjects and objects and control access based upon organization-defined roles and users authorized to assume such roles.

## Implementation Guidance
Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that enforces access to objects and system functions based on the defined role (i.e., job function) of the subject. Organizations can create specific roles based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with the organization-defined roles. When users are assigned to specific roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a large number of individuals) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can also increase privacy and security risk if individuals assigned to a role are given access to information beyond what they need to support organizational missions or business functions. RBAC can be implemented as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For organizations implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in [AC-3(3)](#ac-3.3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.

## Assessment Objectives
a role-based access control policy is enforced over defined subjects; a role-based access control policy is enforced over defined objects; access is controlled based on roles upon which to base control of access are defined; and users authorized to assume roles (defined in AC-03(07)_ODP[01]) are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  role-based access control policies  procedures addressing access enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of roles, users, and associated privileges required to control system access  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with access enforcement responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing role-based access control policy
