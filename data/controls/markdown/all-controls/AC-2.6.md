## Control Statement
Implement dynamic privilege management capabilities are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
In contrast to access control approaches that employ static accounts and predefined user privileges, dynamic access control approaches rely on runtime access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management, such as attribute-based access control. While user identities remain relatively constant over time, user privileges typically change more frequently based on ongoing mission or business requirements and the operational needs of organizations. An example of dynamic privilege management is the immediate revocation of privileges from users as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments of user privileges if they are operating out of their normal work times, if their job function or assignment changes, or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations. Dynamic privilege management includes the effects of privilege changes, for example, when there are changes to encryption keys used for communications.

## Assessment Objectives
dynamic privilege management capabilities are defined; are implemented.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing account management  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system-generated list of dynamic privilege management capabilities  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with account management responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers system or mechanisms implementing dynamic privilege management capabilities
