## Control Statement
Compile audit records from system components from which audit records are compiled into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail are defined; into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within level of tolerance for the relationship between timestamps of individual records in the audit trail is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time ordering of the records within organizational tolerances.

## Assessment Objectives
audit records from system components from which audit records are compiled into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail are defined; are compiled into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within level of tolerance for the relationship between timestamps of individual records in the audit trail is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  system security plan  privacy plan  procedures addressing audit record generation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system-wide audit trail (logical or physical)  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with audit record generation responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms implementing audit record generation capability
