## Control Statement
Analyze outbound communications traffic at external interfaces to the system and at the following interior points to detect covert exfiltration of information: interior points within the system where communications traffic is analyzed are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Organization-defined interior points include subnetworks and subsystems. Covert means that can be used to exfiltrate information include steganography.

## Assessment Objectives
outbound communications traffic is analyzed at interfaces external to the system to detect covert exfiltration of information; outbound communications traffic is analyzed at interior points within the system where communications traffic is analyzed are defined; to detect covert exfiltration of information.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques  system design documentation  network diagram  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system monitoring logs or records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system  organizational personnel responsible for the intrusion detection system Organizational processes for intrusion detection and system monitoring  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion detection and system monitoring capabilities  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing an analysis of outbound communications traffic
