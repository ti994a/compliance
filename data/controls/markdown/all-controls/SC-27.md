## Control Statement
Include within organizational systems the following platform independent applications: platform-independent applications included within organizational systems are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Platforms are combinations of hardware, firmware, and software components used to execute software applications. Platforms include operating systems, the underlying computer architectures, or both. Platform-independent applications are applications with the capability to execute on multiple platforms. Such applications promote portability and reconstitution on different platforms. Application portability and the ability to reconstitute on different platforms increase the availability of mission-essential functions within organizations in situations where systems with specific operating systems are under attack.

## Assessment Objectives
platform-independent applications included within organizational systems are defined; are included within organizational systems.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing platform-independent applications  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of platform-independent applications  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing platform-independent applications
