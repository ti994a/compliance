## Control Statement
Limit the number of external network connections to the system.

## Implementation Guidance
Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted Internet Connection [DHS TIC](#4f42ee6e-86cc-403b-a51f-76c2b4f81b54) initiative is an example of a federal guideline that requires limits on the number of external network connections. Limiting the number of external network connections to the system is important during transition periods from older to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). Such transitions may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period and thus increase the number of access points to the system.

## Assessment Objectives
the number of external network connections to the system is limited.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing boundary protection  system design documentation  boundary protection hardware and software  system architecture and configuration documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  communications and network traffic monitoring logs  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities Mechanisms implementing boundary protection capabilities  mechanisms limiting the number of external network connections to the system
