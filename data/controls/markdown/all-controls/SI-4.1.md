## Control Statement
Connect and configure individual intrusion detection tools into a system-wide intrusion detection system.

## Implementation Guidance
Linking individual intrusion detection tools into a system-wide intrusion detection system provides additional coverage and effective detection capabilities. The information contained in one intrusion detection tool can be shared widely across the organization, making the system-wide detection capability more robust and powerful.

## Assessment Objectives
individual intrusion detection tools are connected to a system-wide intrusion detection system; individual intrusion detection tools are configured into a system-wide intrusion detection system.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques  system design documentation  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system  organizational personnel responsible for the intrusion detection system Organizational processes for intrusion detection and system monitoring  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion detection capabilities
