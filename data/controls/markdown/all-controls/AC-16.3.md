## Control Statement
Maintain the association and integrity of organization-defined security and privacy attributes to organization-defined subjects and objects.

## Implementation Guidance
Maintaining the association and integrity of security and privacy attributes to subjects and objects with sufficient assurance helps to ensure that the attribute associations can be used as the basis of automated policy actions. The integrity of specific items, such as security configuration files, may be maintained through the use of an integrity monitoring mechanism that detects anomalies and changes that deviate from "known good" baselines. Automated policy actions include retention date expirations, access control decisions, information flow control decisions, and information disclosure decisions.

## Assessment Objectives
the association and integrity of security attributes that require association and integrity maintenance are defined; to subjects requiring the association and integrity of security attributes to such subjects maintained are defined; is maintained; the association and integrity of security attributes that require association and integrity maintenance are defined; to objects requiring the association and integrity of security attributes to such objects maintained are defined; is maintained. the association and integrity of privacy attributes that require association and integrity maintenance are defined; to subjects requiring the association and integrity of privacy attributes to such subjects maintained are defined; is maintained; the association and integrity of privacy attributes that require association and integrity maintenance are defined; to objects requiring the association and integrity of privacy attributes to such objects maintained are defined; is maintained.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing the association of security and privacy attributes to information  procedures addressing labeling or marking  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms maintaining association and integrity of security and privacy attributes to information
