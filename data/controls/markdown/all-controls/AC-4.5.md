## Control Statement
Enforce limitations on embedding data types within other data types are defined; on embedding data types within other data types.

## Implementation Guidance
Embedding data types within other data types may result in reduced flow control effectiveness. Data type embedding includes inserting files as objects within other files and using compressed or archived data types that may include multiple embedded data types. Limitations on data type embedding consider the levels of embedding and prohibit levels of data type embedding that are beyond the capability of the inspection tools.

## Assessment Objectives
limitations on embedding data types within other data types are defined; are enforced on embedding data types within other data types.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of limitations to be enforced on embedding data types within other data types  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy
