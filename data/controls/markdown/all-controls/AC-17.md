## Control Statement
Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such connections.

## Implementation Guidance
Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations may use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote access connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of [CA-3](#ca-3) . Enforcing access restrictions for remote access is addressed via [AC-3](#ac-3).

## Assessment Objectives
usage restrictions are established and documented for each type of remote access allowed; configuration/connection requirements are established and documented for each type of remote access allowed; implementation guidance is established and documented for each type of remote access allowed; each type of remote access to the system is authorized prior to allowing such connections.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing remote access implementation and usage (including restrictions)  configuration management plan  system configuration settings and associated documentation  remote access authorizations  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing remote access connections  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Remote access management capability for the system
