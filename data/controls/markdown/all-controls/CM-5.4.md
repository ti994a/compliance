## Control Statement
Enforce dual authorization for implementing changes to organization-defined system components and system-level information.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations employ dual authorization to help ensure that any changes to selected system components and information cannot occur unless two qualified individuals approve and implement such changes. The two individuals possess the skills and expertise to determine if the proposed changes are correct implementations of approved changes. The individuals are also accountable for the changes. Dual authorization may also be known as two-person control. To reduce the risk of collusion, organizations consider rotating dual authorization duties to other individuals. System-level information includes operational procedures.

## Assessment Objectives
dual authorization for implementing changes to system components requiring dual authorization for changes are defined; is enforced; dual authorization for implementing changes to system-level information requiring dual authorization for changes is defined; is enforced.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing access restrictions for changes to the system  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system architecture and configuration documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  change control records  system audit records  system component inventory  system information types information  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with dual authorization enforcement responsibilities for implementing system changes  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for managing access restrictions to change  mechanisms implementing dual authorization enforcement
