## Control Statement
Develop, document, and disseminate to organization-defined personnel or roles: organization-level identification and authentication policy that: Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the identification and authentication policy and the associated identification and authentication controls; Designate an an official to manage the identification and authentication policy and procedures is defined; to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the identification and authentication policy and procedures; and Review and update the current identification and authentication: Policy the frequency at which the current identification and authentication policy is reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require the current identification and authentication policy reviewed and updated are defined; ; and Procedures the frequency at which the current identification and authentication procedures are reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require identification and authentication procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Identification and authentication policy and procedures address the controls in the IA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of identification and authentication policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to identification and authentication policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Assessment Objectives
an identification and authentication policy is developed and documented; the identification and authentication policy is disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the identification and authentication policy is disseminated are defined;; identification and authentication procedures to facilitate the implementation of the identification and authentication policy and associated identification and authentication controls are developed and documented; the identification and authentication procedures are disseminated to personnel or roles to whom the identification and authentication procedures are disseminated; the organization-level identification and authentication policy addresses purpose; the organization-level identification and authentication policy addresses scope; the organization-level identification and authentication policy addresses roles; the organization-level identification and authentication policy addresses responsibilities; the organization-level identification and authentication policy addresses management commitment; the organization-level identification and authentication policy addresses coordination among organizational entities; the organization-level identification and authentication policy addresses compliance; the organization-level identification and authentication policy is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; the an official to manage the identification and authentication policy and procedures is defined; is designated to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the identification and authentication policy and procedures; the current identification and authentication policy is reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current identification and authentication policy is reviewed and updated is defined;; the current identification and authentication policy is reviewed and updated following events that would require the current identification and authentication policy reviewed and updated are defined;; the current identification and authentication procedures are reviewed and updated the frequency at which the current identification and authentication procedures are reviewed and updated is defined;; the current identification and authentication procedures are reviewed and updated following events that would require identification and authentication procedures reviewed and updated are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy and procedures  system security plan  privacy plan  risk management strategy documentation  list of events requiring identification and authentication procedures to be reviewed and updated (e.g., audit findings)  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with identification and authentication responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities
