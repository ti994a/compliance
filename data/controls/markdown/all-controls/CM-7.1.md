## Control Statement
Review the system the frequency at which to review the system to identify unnecessary and/or non-secure functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services is defined; to identify unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, software, and services; and Disable or remove organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, software, and services within the system deemed to be unnecessary and/or nonsecure.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations review functions, ports, protocols, and services provided by systems or system components to determine the functions and services that are candidates for elimination. Such reviews are especially important during transition periods from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transition from IPv4 to IPv6). These technology transitions may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period and returning to minimum essential functions, ports, protocols, and services at the earliest opportunity. Organizations can either decide the relative security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the assessment of other entities. Unsecure protocols include Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking.

## Assessment Objectives
the system is reviewed the frequency at which to review the system to identify unnecessary and/or non-secure functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services is defined; to identify unnecessary and/or non-secure functions, ports, protocols, software, and services: functions disabled or removed when deemed unnecessary or non-secure are defined; deemed to be unnecessary and/or non-secure are disabled or removed; ports disabled or removed when deemed unnecessary or non-secure are defined; deemed to be unnecessary and/or non-secure are disabled or removed; protocols disabled or removed when deemed unnecessary or non-secure are defined; deemed to be unnecessary and/or non-secure are disabled or removed; software disabled or removed when deemed unnecessary or non-secure is defined; deemed to be unnecessary and/or non-secure is disabled or removed; services disabled or removed when deemed unnecessary or non-secure are defined; deemed to be unnecessary and/or non-secure are disabled or removed.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing least functionality in the system  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  common secure configuration checklists  documented reviews of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services  change control records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for reviewing functions, ports, protocols, and services on the system  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Organizational processes for reviewing or disabling functions, ports, protocols, and services on the system  mechanisms implementing review and disabling of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services
