Such functionality allows organizations to implement authentication on output devices prior to the release of output to individuals.

## Assessment Objectives
individual identity is linked to the receipt of output from output devices.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing physical access control  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of output devices and associated outputs requiring physical access controls  physical access control logs or records for areas containing output devices and related outputs  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with physical access control responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Organizational processes for access control to output devices  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access control to output devices
