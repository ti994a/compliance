## Control Statement
Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides to detect and respond to physical security incidents; Review physical access logs the frequency at which to review physical access logs is defined; and upon occurrence of events or potential indication of events requiring physical access logs reviewed are defined; ; and Coordinate results of reviews and investigations with the organizational incident response capability.

## Implementation Guidance
Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities. Examples of physical access monitoring include the employment of guards, video surveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can help identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be supported by audit logging controls, such as [AU-2](#au-2) , if the access logs are part of an automated system. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security incidents and responses to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious physical access activities. Suspicious physical access activities include accesses outside of normal work hours, repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed, accesses for unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence accesses.

## Assessment Objectives
physical access to the facility where the system resides is monitored to detect and respond to physical security incidents; physical access logs are reviewed the frequency at which to review physical access logs is defined;; physical access logs are reviewed upon occurrence of events or potential indication of events requiring physical access logs reviewed are defined;; results of reviews are coordinated with organizational incident response capabilities; results of investigations are coordinated with organizational incident response capabilities.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing physical access monitoring  physical access logs or records  physical access monitoring records  physical access log reviews  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with physical access monitoring responsibilities  organizational personnel with incident response responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for monitoring physical access  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical access monitoring  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the review of physical access logs
