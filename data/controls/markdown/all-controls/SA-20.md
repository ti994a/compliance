## Control Statement
Reimplement or custom develop the following critical system components: critical system components reimplemented or custom-developed are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations determine that certain system components likely cannot be trusted due to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components for which there are no viable security controls to adequately mitigate risk. Reimplementation or custom development of such components may satisfy requirements for higher assurance and is carried out by initiating changes to system components (including hardware, software, and firmware) such that the standard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations where no alternative sourcing is available and organizations choose not to reimplement or custom develop critical system components, additional controls can be employed. Controls include enhanced auditing, restrictions on source code and system utility access, and protection from deletion of system and application files.

## Assessment Objectives
critical system components reimplemented or custom-developed are defined; are reimplemented or custom-developed.

## Assessment Methods
Supply chain risk management plan  system and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the customized development of critical system components  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system development life cycle documentation addressing the custom development of critical system components  configuration management records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibility for the reimplementation or customized development of critical system components Organizational processes for the reimplementation or customized development of critical system components  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the reimplementation or customized development of critical system components
