## Control Statement
When conditions detected to enter a safe mode of operation are defined; are detected, enter a safe mode of operation with restrictions for safe mode of operation are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
For systems that support critical mission and business functions—including military operations, civilian space operations, nuclear power plant operations, and air traffic control operations (especially real-time operational environments)—organizations can identify certain conditions under which those systems revert to a predefined safe mode of operation. The safe mode of operation, which can be activated either automatically or manually, restricts the operations that systems can execute when those conditions are encountered. Restriction includes allowing only selected functions to execute that can be carried out under limited power or with reduced communications bandwidth.

## Assessment Objectives
a safe mode of operation is entered with restrictions for safe mode of operation are defined; when conditions detected to enter a safe mode of operation are defined; are detected.

## Assessment Methods
Contingency planning policy  procedures addressing safe mode of operation for the system  contingency plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system administration manuals  system operation manuals  system installation manuals  contingency plan test records  incident handling records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system operation responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms implementing safe mode of operation
