## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes: systems engineering methods are defined;; {{ insert: param, sa-04.03_odp.03 }}  ; and {{ insert: param, sa-04.03_odp.06 }} .

## Implementation Guidance
Following a system development life cycle that includes state-of-the-practice software development methods, systems engineering methods, systems security and privacy engineering methods, and quality control processes helps to reduce the number and severity of latent errors within systems, system components, and system services. Reducing the number and severity of such errors reduces the number of vulnerabilities in those systems, components, and services. Transparency in the methods and techniques that developers select and implement for systems engineering, systems security and privacy engineering, software development, component and system assessments, and quality control processes provides an increased level of assurance in the trustworthiness of the system, system component, or system service being acquired.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes systems engineering methods are defined;; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes {{ insert: param, sa-04.03_odp.03 }} ; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes {{ insert: param, sa-04.03_odp.06 }} .

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  system and services acquisition procedures  procedures addressing the integration of security and privacy requirements, descriptions, and criteria into the acquisition process  solicitation documents  acquisition documentation  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  list of systems security and privacy engineering methods to be included in the developer’s system development life cycle process  list of software development methods to be included in the developer’s system development life cycle process  list of testing, evaluation, or validation techniques to be included in the developer’s system development life cycle process  list of quality control processes to be included in the developer’s system development life cycle process  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  organizational personnel with system life cycle responsibilities  system developers or service provider Organizational processes for development methods, techniques, and processes
