## Control Statement
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect message externals unless otherwise protected by alternative physical controls to protect message externals are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Cryptographic protection for message externals addresses protection from the unauthorized disclosure of information. Message externals include message headers and routing information. Cryptographic protection prevents the exploitation of message externals and applies to internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized users. Header and routing information is sometimes transmitted in clear text (i.e., unencrypted) because the information is not identified by organizations as having significant value or because encrypting the information can result in lower network performance or higher costs. Alternative physical controls include protected distribution systems.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to protect message externals unless otherwise protected by alternative physical controls to protect message externals are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing transmission confidentiality and integrity  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Cryptographic mechanisms supporting and/or implementing transmission confidentiality and/or integrity for message externals  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing alternative physical safeguards  organizational processes for defining and implementing alternative physical safeguards
