## Control Statement
Employ a wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices and to detect attack attempts and potential compromises or breaches to the system.

## Implementation Guidance
Wireless signals may radiate beyond organizational facilities. Organizations proactively search for unauthorized wireless connections, including the conduct of thorough scans for unauthorized wireless access points. Wireless scans are not limited to those areas within facilities containing systems but also include areas outside of facilities to verify that unauthorized wireless access points are not connected to organizational systems.

## Assessment Objectives
a wireless intrusion detection system is employed to identify rogue wireless devices; a wireless intrusion detection system is employed to detect attack attempts on the system; a wireless intrusion detection system is employed to detect potential compromises or breaches to the system.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques  system design documentation  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system protocols  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system  organizational personnel responsible for the intrusion detection system Organizational processes for intrusion detection  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing a wireless intrusion detection capability
