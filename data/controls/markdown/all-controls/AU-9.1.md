## Control Statement
Write audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media.

## Implementation Guidance
Writing audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media applies to the initial generation of audit trails (i.e., the collection of audit records that represents the information to be used for detection, analysis, and reporting purposes) and to the backup of those audit trails. Writing audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media does not apply to the initial generation of audit records prior to being written to an audit trail. Write-once, read-many (WORM) media includes Compact Disc-Recordable (CD-R), Blu-Ray Disc Recordable (BD-R), and Digital Versatile Disc-Recordable (DVD-R). In contrast, the use of switchable write-protection media, such as tape cartridges, Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives, Compact Disc Re-Writeable (CD-RW), and Digital Versatile Disc-Read Write (DVD-RW) results in write-protected but not write-once media.

## Assessment Objectives
audit trails are written to hardware-enforced, write-once media.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  system security plan  privacy plan  access control policy and procedures  procedures addressing protection of audit information  system design documentation  system hardware settings  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system storage media  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with audit and accountability responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers System media storing audit trails
