## Control Statement
Route networked, privileged accesses through a dedicated, managed interface for purposes of access control and auditing.

## Implementation Guidance
Privileged access provides greater accessibility to system functions, including security functions. Adversaries attempt to gain privileged access to systems through remote access to cause adverse mission or business impacts, such as by exfiltrating information or bringing down a critical system capability. Routing networked, privileged access requests through a dedicated, managed interface further restricts privileged access for increased access control and auditing.

## Assessment Objectives
networked, privileged accesses are routed through a dedicated, managed interface for purposes of access control; networked, privileged accesses are routed through a dedicated, managed interface for purposes of auditing.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing boundary protection  system design documentation  system hardware and software  system architecture  system configuration settings and associated documentation  audit logs  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the routing of networked, privileged access through dedicated, managed interfaces
