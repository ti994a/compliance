## Control Statement
Implement security functions as a layered structure minimizing interactions between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or correctness of higher layers.

## Implementation Guidance
The implementation of layered structures with minimized interactions among security functions and non-looping layers (i.e., lower-layer functions do not depend on higher-layer functions) enables the isolation of security functions and the management of complexity.

## Assessment Objectives
security functions are implemented as a layered structure, minimizing interactions between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or correctness of higher layers.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing security function isolation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for implementing security functions as a layered structure that minimizes interactions between layers and avoids dependence by lower layers on functionality/correctness of higher layers  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing security functions as a layered structure
