## Control Statement
Discover, collect, and distribute to personnel or roles to whom indicators of compromise are distributed , indicators of compromise provided by sources that provide indicators of compromise are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from intrusions that are identified on organizational systems at the host or network level. IOCs provide valuable information on systems that have been compromised. IOCs can include the creation of registry key values. IOCs for network traffic include Universal Resource Locator or protocol elements that indicate malicious code command and control servers. The rapid distribution and adoption of IOCs can improve information security by reducing the time that systems and organizations are vulnerable to the same exploit or attack. Threat indicators, signatures, tactics, techniques, procedures, and other indicators of compromise may be available via government and non-government cooperatives, including the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, the Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Information Sharing Program, and the CERT Coordination Center.

## Assessment Objectives
indicators of compromise provided by sources that provide indicators of compromise are defined; are discovered; indicators of compromise provided by sources that provide indicators of compromise are defined; are collected; indicators of compromise provided by sources that provide indicators of compromise are defined; are distributed to personnel or roles to whom indicators of compromise are distributed.

## Assessment Methods
