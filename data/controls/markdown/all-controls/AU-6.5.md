## Control Statement
Integrate analysis of audit records with analysis of vulnerability scanning information to further enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.

## Implementation Guidance
Integrated analysis of audit records does not require vulnerability scanning, the generation of performance data, or system monitoring. Rather, integrated analysis requires that the analysis of information generated by scanning, monitoring, or other data collection activities is integrated with the analysis of audit record information. Security Information and Event Management tools can facilitate audit record aggregation or consolidation from multiple system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans of the system and in correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can uncover denial-of-service attacks or other types of attacks that result in the unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit information to operational situations.

## Assessment Objectives
analysis of audit records is integrated with analysis of vulnerability scanning information to further enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  system security plan  privacy plan  procedures addressing audit review, analysis, and reporting  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  integrated analysis of audit records, vulnerability scanning information, performance data, network monitoring information, and associated documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis, and reporting responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Mechanisms implementing the capability to integrate analysis of audit records with analysis of data/information sources
