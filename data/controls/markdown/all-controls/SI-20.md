## Control Statement
Embed data or capabilities in the following systems or system components to determine if organizational data has been exfiltrated or improperly removed from the organization: the systems or system components with data or capabilities embedded are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Many cyber-attacks target organizational information, or information that the organization holds on behalf of other entities (e.g., personally identifiable information), and exfiltrate that data. In addition, insider attacks and erroneous user procedures can remove information from the system that is in violation of the organizational policies. Tainting approaches can range from passive to active. A passive tainting approach can be as simple as adding false email names and addresses to an internal database. If the organization receives email at one of the false email addresses, it knows that the database has been compromised. Moreover, the organization knows that the email was sent by an unauthorized entity, so any packets it includes potentially contain malicious code, and that the unauthorized entity may have potentially obtained a copy of the database. Another tainting approach can include embedding false data or steganographic data in files to enable the data to be found via open-source analysis. Finally, an active tainting approach can include embedding software in the data that is able to "call home," thereby alerting the organization to its "capture," and possibly its location, and the path by which it was exfiltrated or removed.

## Assessment Objectives
data or capabilities are embedded in the systems or system components with data or capabilities embedded are defined; to determine if organizational data has been exfiltrated or improperly removed from the organization.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  personally identifiable information processing policy  procedures addressing software and information integrity  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  policy and procedures addressing the systems security engineering technique of deception  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for detecting tainted data  organizational personnel with systems security engineering responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Automated mechanisms for post-breach detection  decoys, traps, lures, and methods for deceiving adversaries  detection and notification mechanisms
