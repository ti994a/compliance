## Control Statement
Employ access control vestibules at locations within the facility where access control vestibules are employed are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
An access control vestibule is part of a physical access control system that typically provides a space between two sets of interlocking doors. Vestibules are designed to prevent unauthorized individuals from following authorized individuals into facilities with controlled access. This activity, also known as piggybacking or tailgating, results in unauthorized access to the facility. Interlocking door controllers can be used to limit the number of individuals who enter controlled access points and to provide containment areas while authorization for physical access is verified. Interlocking door controllers can be fully automated (i.e., controlling the opening and closing of the doors) or partially automated (i.e., using security guards to control the number of individuals entering the containment area).
