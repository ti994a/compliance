## Control Statement
Employ fire detection systems that activate automatically and notify personnel or roles notified in the event of a fire and emergency responders notified in the event of a fire are defined; in the event of a fire.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations can identify personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have access authorizations or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the classification or impact level of information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.

## Assessment Objectives
fire detection systems that activate automatically are employed in the event of a fire; fire detection systems that notify personnel or roles notified in the event of a fire automatically are employed in the event of a fire; fire detection systems that notify emergency responders notified in the event of a fire are defined; automatically are employed in the event of a fire.

## Assessment Methods
