## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of economic security in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of economic security are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of economic security states that security mechanisms are not costlier than the potential damage that could occur from a security breach. This is the security-relevant form of the cost-benefit analyses used in risk management. The cost assumptions of cost-benefit analysis prevent the system designer from incorporating security mechanisms of greater strength than necessary, where strength of mechanism is proportional to cost. The principle of economic security also requires analysis of the benefits of assurance relative to the cost of that assurance in terms of the effort expended to obtain relevant and credible evidence as well as the necessary analyses to assess and draw trustworthiness and risk conclusions from the evidence.

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of economic security are defined; implement the security design principle of economic security.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the security design principle of economic security used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  cost-benefit analysis  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of economic security in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of economic security in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification
