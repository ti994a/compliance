## Control Statement
Prevent disclosure of personally identifiable information by adding non-deterministic noise to the results of mathematical operations before the results are reported.

## Implementation Guidance
The mathematical definition for differential privacy holds that the result of a dataset analysis should be approximately the same before and after the addition or removal of a single data record (which is assumed to be the data from a single individual). In its most basic form, differential privacy applies only to online query systems. However, it can also be used to produce machine-learning statistical classifiers and synthetic data. Differential privacy comes at the cost of decreased accuracy of results, forcing organizations to quantify the trade-off between privacy protection and the overall accuracy, usefulness, and utility of the de-identified dataset. Non-deterministic noise can include adding small, random values to the results of mathematical operations in dataset analysis.

## Assessment Objectives
the disclosure of personally identifiable information is prevented by adding non-deterministic noise to the results of mathematical operations before the results are reported.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  personally identifiable information processing policy  de-identification procedures  system configuration  de-identified datasets  differential privacy tools  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for de-identifying the dataset  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Online query systems  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing differential privacy
