## Control Statement
Implement organization-defined techniques and technologies in associating security and privacy attributes to information.

## Implementation Guidance
The association of security and privacy attributes to information within systems is important for conducting automated access enforcement and flow enforcement actions. The association of such attributes to information (i.e., binding) can be accomplished with technologies and techniques that provide different levels of assurance. For example, systems can cryptographically bind attributes to information using digital signatures that support cryptographic keys protected by hardware devices (sometimes known as hardware roots of trust).

## Assessment Objectives
techniques and technologies implemented in associating security attributes to information are defined; are implemented in associating security attributes to information; techniques and technologies implemented in associating privacy attributes to information are defined; are implemented in associating privacy attributes to information.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing association of security and privacy attributes to information  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for associating security and privacy attributes to information  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing techniques or technologies associating security and privacy attributes to information
