## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform attack surface reviews.

## Implementation Guidance
Attack surfaces of systems and system components are exposed areas that make those systems more vulnerable to attacks. Attack surfaces include any accessible areas where weaknesses or deficiencies in the hardware, software, and firmware components provide opportunities for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities. Attack surface reviews ensure that developers analyze the design and implementation changes to systems and mitigate attack vectors generated as a result of the changes. The correction of identified flaws includes deprecation of unsafe functions.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to perform attack surface reviews.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing system developer security testing  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  system developer security testing and evaluation plans  system developer security testing and evaluation results  records of attack surface reviews  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with developer security testing responsibilities  organizational personnel with configuration management responsibilities  system developers Organizational processes for monitoring developer security testing and evaluation  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the monitoring of developer security testing and evaluation
