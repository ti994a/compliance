## Control Statement
Employ integrity verification tools to detect unauthorized changes to the following software, firmware, and information: organization-defined software, firmware, and information ; and Take the following actions when unauthorized changes to the software, firmware, and information are detected: organization-defined actions.

## Implementation Guidance
Unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information can occur due to errors or malicious activity. Software includes operating systems (with key internal components, such as kernels or drivers), middleware, and applications. Firmware interfaces include Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). Information includes personally identifiable information and metadata that contains security and privacy attributes associated with information. Integrity-checking mechanisms—including parity checks, cyclical redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes, and associated tools—can automatically monitor the integrity of systems and hosted applications.

## Assessment Objectives
integrity verification tools are employed to detect unauthorized changes to software requiring integrity verification tools employed to detect unauthorized changes is defined;; integrity verification tools are employed to detect unauthorized changes to firmware requiring integrity verification tools employed to detect unauthorized changes is defined;; integrity verification tools are employed to detect unauthorized changes to information requiring integrity verification tools employed to detect unauthorized changes is defined;; actions taken when unauthorized changes to software are detected are defined; are taken when unauthorized changes to the software, are detected; actions taken when unauthorized changes to firmware are detected are defined; are taken when unauthorized changes to the firmware are detected; actions taken when unauthorized changes to information are detected are defined; are taken when unauthorized changes to the information are detected.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing software, firmware, and information integrity  personally identifiable information processing policy  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  integrity verification tools and associated documentation  records generated or triggered by integrity verification tools regarding unauthorized software, firmware, and information changes  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for software, firmware, and/or information integrity  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators Software, firmware, and information integrity verification tools
