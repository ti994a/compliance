## Control Statement
Implement controls implemented for application self-protection at runtime are defined; for application self-protection at runtime.

## Implementation Guidance
Runtime application self-protection employs runtime instrumentation to detect and block the exploitation of software vulnerabilities by taking advantage of information from the software in execution. Runtime exploit prevention differs from traditional perimeter-based protections such as guards and firewalls which can only detect and block attacks by using network information without contextual awareness. Runtime application self-protection technology can reduce the susceptibility of software to attacks by monitoring its inputs and blocking those inputs that could allow attacks. It can also help protect the runtime environment from unwanted changes and tampering. When a threat is detected, runtime application self-protection technology can prevent exploitation and take other actions (e.g., sending a warning message to the user, terminating the user's session, terminating the application, or sending an alert to organizational personnel). Runtime application self-protection solutions can be deployed in either a monitor or protection mode.

## Assessment Objectives
controls implemented for application self-protection at runtime are defined; are implemented for application self-protection at runtime.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing software and information integrity  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of known vulnerabilities addressed by runtime instrumentation  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for software, firmware, and/or information integrity  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Software, firmware, and information integrity verification tools  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing runtime application self-protection
