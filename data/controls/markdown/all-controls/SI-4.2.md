## Control Statement
Employ automated tools and mechanisms to support near real-time analysis of events.

## Implementation Guidance
Automated tools and mechanisms include host-based, network-based, transport-based, or storage-based event monitoring tools and mechanisms or security information and event management (SIEM) technologies that provide real-time analysis of alerts and notifications generated by organizational systems. Automated monitoring techniques can create unintended privacy risks because automated controls may connect to external or otherwise unrelated systems. The matching of records between these systems may create linkages with unintended consequences. Organizations assess and document these risks in their privacy impact assessment and make determinations that are in alignment with their privacy program plan.

## Assessment Objectives
automated tools and mechanisms are employed to support a near real-time analysis of events.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques  system design documentation  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy program plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk management documentation  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system  organizational personnel responsible for incident response/management Organizational processes for the near real-time analysis of events  organizational processes for system monitoring  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system monitoring  mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing an analysis of events
