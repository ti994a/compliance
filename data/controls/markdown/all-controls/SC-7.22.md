## Control Statement
Implement separate network addresses to connect to systems in different security domains.

## Implementation Guidance
The decomposition of systems into subnetworks (i.e., subnets) helps to provide the appropriate level of protection for network connections to different security domains that contain information with different security categories or classification levels.

## Assessment Objectives
separate network addresses are implemented to connect to systems in different security domains.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing boundary protection  system design documentation  system hardware and software  system architecture  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing separate network addresses/different subnets
