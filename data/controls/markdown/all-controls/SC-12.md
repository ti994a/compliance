## Control Statement
Establish and manage cryptographic keys when cryptography is employed within the system in accordance with the following key management requirements: requirements for key generation, distribution, storage, access, and destruction are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using manual procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual procedures. Organizations define key management requirements in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines and specify appropriate options, parameters, and levels. Organizations manage trust stores to ensure that only approved trust anchors are part of such trust stores. This includes certificates with visibility external to organizational systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems. [NIST CMVP](#1acdc775-aafb-4d11-9341-dc6a822e9d38) and [NIST CAVP](#84dc1b0c-acb7-4269-84c4-00dbabacd78c) provide additional information on validated cryptographic modules and algorithms that can be used in cryptographic key management and establishment.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic keys are established when cryptography is employed within the system in accordance with requirements for key generation, distribution, storage, access, and destruction are defined;; cryptographic keys are managed when cryptography is employed within the system in accordance with requirements for key generation, distribution, storage, access, and destruction are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing cryptographic key establishment and management  system design documentation  cryptographic mechanisms  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibilities for cryptographic key establishment and/or management Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing cryptographic key establishment and management
