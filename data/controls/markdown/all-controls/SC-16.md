## Control Statement
Associate organization-defined security and privacy attributes with information exchanged between systems and between system components.

## Implementation Guidance
Security and privacy attributes can be explicitly or implicitly associated with the information contained in organizational systems or system components. Attributes are abstractions that represent the basic properties or characteristics of an entity with respect to protecting information or the management of personally identifiable information. Attributes are typically associated with internal data structures, including records, buffers, and files within the system. Security and privacy attributes are used to implement access control and information flow control policies; reflect special dissemination, management, or distribution instructions, including permitted uses of personally identifiable information; or support other aspects of the information security and privacy policies. Privacy attributes may be used independently or in conjunction with security attributes.

## Assessment Objectives
security attributes associated with information exchanged are defined; are associated with information exchanged between systems; security attributes associated with information exchanged are defined; are associated with information exchanged between system components; privacy attributes associated with information exchanged are defined; are associated with information exchanged between systems; privacy attributes associated with information exchanged are defined; are associated with information exchanged between system components.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing the transmission of security and privacy attributes  access control policy and procedures  information flow control policy  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the transmission of security and privacy attributes between systems
