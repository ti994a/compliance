## Control Statement
Increase the availability of incident response information and support using automated mechanisms used to increase the availability of incident response information and support are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Automated mechanisms can provide a push or pull capability for users to obtain incident response assistance. For example, individuals may have access to a website to query the assistance capability, or the assistance capability can proactively send incident response information to users (general distribution or targeted) as part of increasing understanding of current response capabilities and support.

## Assessment Objectives
the availability of incident response information and support is increased using automated mechanisms used to increase the availability of incident response information and support are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Incident response policy  procedures addressing incident response assistance  automated mechanisms supporting incident response support and assistance  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  incident response plan  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with incident response support and assistance responsibilities  organizational personnel with access to incident response support and assistance capability  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for incident response assistance  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing an increase in the availability of incident response information and support
