## Control Statement
When transferring information between different security domains, use data type identifiers used to validate data essential for information flow decisions are defined; to validate data essential for information flow decisions.

## Implementation Guidance
Data type identifiers include filenames, file types, file signatures or tokens, and multiple internal file signatures or tokens. Systems only allow transfer of data that is compliant with data type format specifications. Identification and validation of data types is based on defined specifications associated with each allowed data format. The filename and number alone are not used for data type identification. Content is validated syntactically and semantically against its specification to ensure that it is the proper data type.

## Assessment Objectives
when transferring information between different security domains, data type identifiers used to validate data essential for information flow decisions are defined; are used to validate data essential for information flow decisions.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  information flow control policies  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of data type identifiers  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy
