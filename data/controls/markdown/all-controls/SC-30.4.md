## Control Statement
Employ realistic, but misleading information in system components for which realistic but misleading information about their security state or posture is employed are defined; about its security state or posture.

## Implementation Guidance
Employing misleading information is intended to confuse potential adversaries regarding the nature and extent of controls deployed by organizations. Thus, adversaries may employ incorrect and ineffective attack techniques. One technique for misleading adversaries is for organizations to place misleading information regarding the specific controls deployed in external systems that are known to be targeted by adversaries. Another technique is the use of deception nets that mimic actual aspects of organizational systems but use, for example, out-of-date software configurations.

## Assessment Objectives
realistic but misleading information about the security state or posture of system components for which realistic but misleading information about their security state or posture is employed are defined; is employed.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  configuration management policy and procedures  procedures addressing concealment and misdirection techniques for the system  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with the responsibility to define and employ realistic but misleading information about the security posture of system components Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the employment of realistic but misleading information about the security posture of system components
