## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to: Define quality metrics at the beginning of the development process; and Provide evidence of meeting the quality metrics {{ insert: param, sa-15.01_odp.02 }} .

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations use quality metrics to establish acceptable levels of system quality. Metrics can include quality gates, which are collections of completion criteria or sufficiency standards that represent the satisfactory execution of specific phases of the system development project. For example, a quality gate may require the elimination of all compiler warnings or a determination that such warnings have no impact on the effectiveness of required security or privacy capabilities. During the execution phases of development projects, quality gates provide clear, unambiguous indications of progress. Other metrics apply to the entire development project. Metrics can include defining the severity thresholds of vulnerabilities in accordance with organizational risk tolerance, such as requiring no known vulnerabilities in the delivered system with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) severity of medium or high.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to define quality metrics at the beginning of the development process; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to provide evidence of meeting the quality metrics {{ insert: param, sa-15.01_odp.02 }} .

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing development process, standards, and tools  procedures addressing the integration of security requirements into the acquisition process  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  list of quality metrics  documentation evidence of meeting quality metrics  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer
