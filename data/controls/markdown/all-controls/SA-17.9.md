## Control Statement
Use different designs for critical systems or system components designed differently are defined; to satisfy a common set of requirements or to provide equivalent functionality.

## Implementation Guidance
Design diversity is achieved by supplying the same requirements specification to multiple developers, each of whom is responsible for developing a variant of the system or system component that meets the requirements. Variants can be in software design, in hardware design, or in both hardware and a software design. Differences in the designs of the variants can result from developer experience (e.g., prior use of a design pattern), design style (e.g., when decomposing a required function into smaller tasks, determining what constitutes a separate task and how far to decompose tasks into sub-tasks), selection of libraries to incorporate into the variant, and the development environment (e.g., different design tools make some design patterns easier to visualize). Hardware design diversity includes making different decisions about what information to keep in analog form and what information to convert to digital form, transmitting the same information at different times, and introducing delays in sampling (temporal diversity). Design diversity is commonly used to support fault tolerance.

## Assessment Objectives
different designs are used for critical systems or system components designed differently are defined; to satisfy a common set of requirements or to provide equivalent functionality.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  enterprise architecture policy  procedures addressing developer security architecture and design diversity for the system  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  system design documentation  system security architecture documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  developer documentation describing design diversity  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with information security architecture responsibilities
