## Control Statement
Employ organizational analysis of the following supply chain elements, processes, and actors associated with the system, system component, or system service: supply chain elements, processes, and actors analyzed and tested are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Relationships between entities and procedures within the supply chain, including development and delivery, are considered. Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools that are used for the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, maintenance, and disposal of systems, system components, or system services. Supply chain processes include supply chain risk management programs; SCRM strategies and implementation plans; personnel and physical security programs; hardware, software, and firmware development processes; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; shipping and handling procedures; and programs, processes, or procedures associated with the production and distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain actors are individuals with specific roles and responsibilities in the supply chain. The evidence generated and collected during analyses and testing of supply chain elements, processes, and actors is documented and used to inform organizational risk management activities and decisions.

## Assessment Objectives
organizational analysis is/are employed on supply chain elements, processes, and actors analyzed and tested are defined; associated with the system, system component, or system service.

## Assessment Methods
Supply chain risk management policy and procedures  supply chain risk management plan  system and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing supply chain protection  evidence of organizational analysis, independent third-party analysis, organizational penetration testing, and/or independent third-party penetration testing  list of supply chain elements, processes, and actors (associated with the system, system component, or system service) subject to analysis and/or testing  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and services acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibilities for analyzing and/or testing supply chain elements, processes, and actors Organizational processes for defining and employing methods of analysis/testing of supply chain elements, processes, and actors  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the analysis/testing of supply chain elements, processes, and actors
