## Control Statement
Include the following types of dynamic reconfiguration for system components that require dynamic reconfiguration are defined; as part of the incident response capability: types of dynamic reconfiguration for system components are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Dynamic reconfiguration includes changes to router rules, access control lists, intrusion detection or prevention system parameters, and filter rules for guards or firewalls. Organizations may perform dynamic reconfiguration of systems to stop attacks, misdirect attackers, and isolate components of systems, thus limiting the extent of the damage from breaches or compromises. Organizations include specific time frames for achieving the reconfiguration of systems in the definition of the reconfiguration capability, considering the potential need for rapid response to effectively address cyber threats.

## Assessment Objectives
types of dynamic reconfiguration for system components are defined; for system components that require dynamic reconfiguration are defined; are included as part of the incident response capability.

## Assessment Methods
Incident response policy  procedures addressing incident handling  mechanisms supporting incident handling  list of system components to be dynamically reconfigured as part of incident response capability  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  incident response plan  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with incident handling responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms that support and/or implement the dynamic reconfiguration of components as part of incident response
