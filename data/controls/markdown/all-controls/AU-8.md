## Control Statement
Use internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and Record time stamps for audit records that meet granularity of time measurement for audit record timestamps is defined; and that use Coordinated Universal Time, have a fixed local time offset from Coordinated Universal Time, or that include the local time offset as part of the time stamp.

## Implementation Guidance
Time stamps generated by the system include date and time. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time granularities for different system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.

## Assessment Objectives
internal system clocks are used to generate timestamps for audit records; timestamps are recorded for audit records that meet granularity of time measurement for audit record timestamps is defined; and that use Coordinated Universal Time, have a fixed local time offset from Coordinated Universal Time, or include the local time offset as part of the timestamp.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  system security plan  privacy plan  procedures addressing timestamp generation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms implementing timestamp generation
