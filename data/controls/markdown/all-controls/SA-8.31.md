## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of secure system modification in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of secure system modification are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of secure system modification states that system modification maintains system security with respect to the security requirements and risk tolerance of stakeholders. Upgrades or modifications to systems can transform secure systems into systems that are not secure. The procedures for system modification ensure that if the system is to maintain its trustworthiness, the same rigor that was applied to its initial development is applied to any system changes. Because modifications can affect the ability of the system to maintain its secure state, a careful security analysis of the modification is needed prior to its implementation and deployment. This principle parallels the principle of secure evolvability.

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of secure system modification are defined; implement the security design principle of secure system modification.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  configuration management policy and procedures  procedures addressing the security design principle of secure system modification used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  change control records  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of secure system modification in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of secure system modification in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms that enforce security policies  organizational processes for managing change configuration  mechanisms supporting configuration control
