## Control Statement
Establish a system media downgrading process is defined; that includes employing downgrading mechanisms with strength and integrity commensurate with the security category or classification of the information; Verify that the system media downgrading process is commensurate with the security category and/or classification level of the information to be removed and the access authorizations of the potential recipients of the downgraded information; Identify system media requiring downgrading is defined; ; and Downgrade the identified system media using the established process.

## Implementation Guidance
Media downgrading applies to digital and non-digital media subject to release outside of the organization, whether the media is considered removable or not. When applied to system media, the downgrading process removes information from the media, typically by security category or classification level, such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Downgrading of media includes redacting information to enable wider release and distribution. Downgrading ensures that empty space on the media is devoid of information.

## Assessment Objectives
a a system media downgrading process is defined; is established; the a system media downgrading process is defined; includes employing downgrading mechanisms with strength and integrity commensurate with the security category or classification of the information; there is verification that the system media downgrading process is commensurate with the security category and/or classification level of the information to be removed; there is verification that the system media downgrading process is commensurate with the access authorizations of the potential recipients of the downgraded information; system media requiring downgrading is defined; is identified; the identified system media is downgraded using the a system media downgrading process is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System media protection policy  procedures addressing media downgrading  system categorization documentation  list of media requiring downgrading  records of media downgrading  audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system media downgrading responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for media downgrading  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media downgrading
