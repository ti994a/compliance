**Family:** Identification and Authentication

**Keywords:** Assessment, assessment plan, assurance, availability, computer security, confidentiality, control, control assessment, cybersecurity, FISMA, information security, information system, integrity, personally identifiable information, OSCAL, Open Security Controls Assessment Language, Privacy Act, privacy controls, privacy functions, privacy requirements, Risk Management Framework, security controls, security functions, security requirements, system, system security

## Control Statement
Uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational users or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users.

## Implementation Guidance
Non-organizational users include system users other than organizational users explicitly covered by [IA-2](#ia-2) . Non-organizational users are uniquely identified and authenticated for accesses other than those explicitly identified and documented in [AC-14](#ac-14) . Identification and authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal systems may be required to protect federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security systems). Organizations consider many factors—including security, privacy, scalability, and practicality—when balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information and systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk.

## Assessment Objectives
non-organizational users or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users are uniquely identified and authenticated.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  privacy plan  procedures addressing user identification and authentication  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  list of system accounts  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system operations responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification and authentication capabilities
