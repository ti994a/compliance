## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of trusted communications channels in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of trusted communications channels are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of trusted communication channels states that when composing a system where there is a potential threat to communications between components (i.e., the interconnections between components), each communication channel is trustworthy to a level commensurate with the security dependencies it supports (i.e., how much it is trusted by other components to perform its security functions). Trusted communication channels are achieved by a combination of restricting access to the communication channel (to ensure an acceptable match in the trustworthiness of the endpoints involved in the communication) and employing end-to-end protections for the data transmitted over the communication channel (to protect against interception and modification and to further increase the assurance of proper end-to-end communication).

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of trusted communications channels are defined; implement the security design principle of trusted communications channels.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the security design principle of trusted communications channels used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of trusted communications channels in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of trusted communications channels in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification
