## Control Statement
Obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation and use by unauthorized individuals.

## Implementation Guidance
Authentication feedback from systems does not provide information that would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of systems, such as desktops or notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems, such as mobile devices with small displays, the threat may be less significant and is balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors due to small keyboards. Thus, the means for obscuring authentication feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring authentication feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time before obscuring it.

## Assessment Objectives
the feedback of authentication information is obscured during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation and use by unauthorized individuals.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing authenticator feedback  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the obscuring of feedback of authentication information during authentication
