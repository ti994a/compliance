## Control Statement
Provide a single sign-on capability for system accounts and services for which a single sign-on capability must be provided are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Single sign-on enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple system resources. Organizations consider the operational efficiencies provided by single sign-on capabilities with the risk introduced by allowing access to multiple systems via a single authentication event. Single sign-on can present opportunities to improve system security, for example by providing the ability to add multi-factor authentication for applications and systems (existing and new) that may not be able to natively support multi-factor authentication.

## Assessment Objectives
a single sign-on capability is provided for system accounts and services for which a single sign-on capability must be provided are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing single sign-on capability for system accounts and services  procedures addressing identification and authentication  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  list of system accounts and services requiring single sign-on capability  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system operations responsibilities  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification and authentication capabilities  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing single sign-on capability for system accounts and services
