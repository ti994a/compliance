## Control Statement
Prevent access to security-relevant information to which access is prevented except during secure, non-operable system states is defined; except during secure, non-operable system states.

## Implementation Guidance
Security-relevant information is information within systems that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a manner that could result in failure to enforce system security and privacy policies or maintain the separation of code and data. Security-relevant information includes access control lists, filtering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, and cryptographic key management information. Secure, non-operable system states include the times in which systems are not performing mission or business-related processing, such as when the system is offline for maintenance, boot-up, troubleshooting, or shut down.

## Assessment Objectives
access to security-relevant information to which access is prevented except during secure, non-operable system states is defined; is prevented except during secure, non-operable system states.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing access enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with access enforcement responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms preventing access to security-relevant information within the system
