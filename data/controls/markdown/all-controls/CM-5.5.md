## Control Statement
Limit privileges to change system components and system-related information within a production or operational environment; and Review and reevaluate privileges organization-defined frequency.

## Implementation Guidance
In many organizations, systems support multiple mission and business functions. Limiting privileges to change system components with respect to operational systems is necessary because changes to a system component may have far-reaching effects on mission and business processes supported by the system. The relationships between systems and mission/business processes are, in some cases, unknown to developers. System-related information includes operational procedures.

## Assessment Objectives
privileges to change system components within a production or operational environment are limited; privileges to change system-related information within a production or operational environment are limited; privileges are reviewed frequency at which to review privileges is defined;; privileges are reevaluated frequency at which to reevaluate privileges is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing access restrictions for changes to the system  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system architecture and configuration documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  user privilege reviews  user privilege recertifications  system component inventory  change control records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for managing access restrictions to change  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access restrictions for change
