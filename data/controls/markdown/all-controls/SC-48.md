## Control Statement
Relocate sensors and monitoring capabilities relocated are defined; to locations to where sensors and monitoring capabilities are relocated are defined; under the following conditions or circumstances: conditions or circumstances for relocating sensors and monitoring capabilities are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Adversaries may take various paths and use different approaches as they move laterally through an organization (including its systems) to reach their target or as they attempt to exfiltrate information from the organization. The organization often only has a limited set of monitoring and detection capabilities, and they may be focused on the critical or likely infiltration or exfiltration paths. By using communications paths that the organization typically does not monitor, the adversary can increase its chances of achieving its desired goals. By relocating its sensors or monitoring capabilities to new locations, the organization can impede the adversary’s ability to achieve its goals. The relocation of the sensors or monitoring capabilities might be done based on threat information that the organization has acquired or randomly to confuse the adversary and make its lateral transition through the system or organization more challenging.

## Assessment Objectives
sensors and monitoring capabilities relocated are defined; are relocated to locations to where sensors and monitoring capabilities are relocated are defined; under conditions or circumstances for relocating sensors and monitoring capabilities are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing sensor and monitoring capability relocation  list of sensors/monitoring capabilities to be relocated  change control records  configuration management records  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing sensor relocation
