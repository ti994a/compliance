## Control Statement
Enforce organization-defined mandatory access control policy over the set of covered subjects and objects specified in the policy; and Enforce organization-defined discretionary access control policy over the set of covered subjects and objects specified in the policy.

## Implementation Guidance
Simultaneously implementing a mandatory access control policy and a discretionary access control policy can provide additional protection against the unauthorized execution of code by users or processes acting on behalf of users. This helps prevent a single compromised user or process from compromising the entire system.

## Assessment Objectives
a mandatory access control policy enforced over the set of covered subjects specified in the policy is defined; is enforced over the set of covered subjects specified in the policy; a mandatory access control policy enforced over the set of covered objects specified in the policy is defined; is enforced over the set of covered objects specified in the policy; a discretionary access control policy enforced over the set of covered subjects specified in the policy is defined; is enforced over the set of covered subjects specified in the policy; a discretionary access control policy enforced over the set of covered objects specified in the policy is defined; is enforced over the set of covered objects specified in the policy.

## Assessment Methods
