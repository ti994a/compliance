## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service frequency at which to conduct vulnerability analysis is defined; to: Perform an automated vulnerability analysis using tools used to perform automated vulnerability analysis are defined;; Determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities; Determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and Deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to personnel or roles to whom the outputs of tools and results of the analysis are delivered.

## Implementation Guidance
Automated tools can be more effective at analyzing exploitable weaknesses or deficiencies in large and complex systems, prioritizing vulnerabilities by severity, and providing recommendations for risk mitigations.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to perform automated vulnerability analysis frequency at which to conduct vulnerability analysis is defined; using tools used to perform automated vulnerability analysis are defined;; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities frequency at which to conduct vulnerability analysis is defined;; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to determine potential risk mitigations frequency at which to conduct vulnerability analysis is defined; for delivered vulnerabilities; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis frequency at which to conduct vulnerability analysis is defined; to personnel or roles to whom the outputs of tools and results of the analysis are delivered.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing development process, standards, and tools  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  vulnerability analysis tools and associated documentation  risk assessment reports  vulnerability analysis results  vulnerability mitigation reports  risk mitigation strategy documentation  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel performing automated vulnerability analysis on the system Organizational processes for vulnerability analysis of systems, system components, or system services under development  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing vulnerability analysis of systems, system components, or system services under development
