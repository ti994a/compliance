## Control Statement
Employ boundary protection mechanisms to isolate system components isolated by boundary protection mechanisms are defined; supporting missions and/or business functions supported by system components isolated by boundary protection mechanisms are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations can isolate system components that perform different mission or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized information flows among system components and provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of protection for selected system components. Isolating system components with boundary protection mechanisms provides the capability for increased protection of individual system components and to more effectively control information flows between those components. Isolating system components provides enhanced protection that limits the potential harm from hostile cyber-attacks and errors. The degree of isolation varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen. Boundary protection mechanisms include routers, gateways, and firewalls that separate system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks; cross-domain devices that separate subnetworks; virtualization techniques; and the encryption of information flows among system components using distinct encryption keys.

## Assessment Objectives
boundary protection mechanisms are employed to isolate system components isolated by boundary protection mechanisms are defined; supporting missions and/or business functions supported by system components isolated by boundary protection mechanisms are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing boundary protection  system design documentation  system hardware and software  enterprise architecture documentation  system architecture  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the capability to separate system components supporting organizational missions and/or business functions
