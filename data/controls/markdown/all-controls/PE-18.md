## Control Statement
Position system components within the facility to minimize potential damage from physical and environmental hazards that could result in potential damage to system components within the facility are defined; and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access.

## Implementation Guidance
Physical and environmental hazards include floods, fires, tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, terrorism, vandalism, an electromagnetic pulse, electrical interference, and other forms of incoming electromagnetic radiation. Organizations consider the location of entry points where unauthorized individuals, while not being granted access, might nonetheless be near systems. Such proximity can increase the risk of unauthorized access to organizational communications using wireless packet sniffers or microphones, or unauthorized disclosure of information.

## Assessment Objectives
system components are positioned within the facility to minimize potential damage from physical and environmental hazards that could result in potential damage to system components within the facility are defined; and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing the positioning of system components  documentation providing the location and position of system components within the facility  locations housing system components within the facility  list of physical and environmental hazards with the potential to damage system components within the facility  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for positioning system components  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for positioning system components
