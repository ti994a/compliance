## Control Statement
Perform predictive maintenance on system components on which predictive maintenance is performed are defined; at time intervals within which predictive maintenance is performed are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Predictive maintenance evaluates the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance at a scheduled time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the objective of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition. The predictive maintenance approach employs principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while equipment is in service, thus minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability.

## Assessment Objectives
predictive maintenance is performed on system components on which predictive maintenance is performed are defined; at time intervals within which predictive maintenance is performed are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
