## Control Statement
Apply nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable storage devices prior to connecting such devices to the system under the following circumstances: circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage devices are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Portable storage devices include external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state, magnetic), optical discs, magnetic or optical tapes, flash memory devices, flash memory cards, and other external or removable disks. Portable storage devices can be obtained from untrustworthy sources and contain malicious code that can be inserted into or transferred to organizational systems through USB ports or other entry portals. While scanning storage devices is recommended, sanitization provides additional assurance that such devices are free of malicious code. Organizations consider nondestructive sanitization of portable storage devices when the devices are purchased from manufacturers or vendors prior to initial use or when organizations cannot maintain a positive chain of custody for the devices.

## Assessment Objectives
non-destructive sanitization techniques are applied to portable storage devices prior to connecting such devices to the system under circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage devices are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System media protection policy  procedures addressing media sanitization and disposal  information on portable storage devices for the system  list of circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage devices  media sanitization records  audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system media sanitization responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for media sanitization of portable storage devices  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media sanitization
