## Control Statement
Manage, apply, and verify configuration settings for system components for which to manage, apply, and verify configuration settings are defined; using organization-defined automated mechanisms.

## Implementation Guidance
Automated tools (e.g., hardening tools, baseline configuration tools) can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of configuration settings information. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities, alerting mechanisms, and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization.

## Assessment Objectives
configuration settings for system components for which to manage, apply, and verify configuration settings are defined; are managed using automated mechanisms to manage configuration settings are defined;; configuration settings for system components for which to manage, apply, and verify configuration settings are defined; are applied using automated mechanisms to apply configuration settings are defined;; configuration settings for system components for which to manage, apply, and verify configuration settings are defined; are verified using automated mechanisms to verify configuration settings are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing configuration settings for the system  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system component inventory  common secure configuration checklists  change control records  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with security configuration management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Organizational processes for managing configuration settings  automated mechanisms implemented to manage, apply, and verify system configuration settings
