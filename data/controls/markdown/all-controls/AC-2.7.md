## Control Statement
Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access scheme; Monitor privileged role or attribute assignments; Monitor changes to roles or attributes; and Revoke access when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer appropriate.

## Implementation Guidance
Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Privileged roles include key management, account management, database administration, system and network administration, and web administration. A role-based access scheme organizes permitted system access and privileges into roles. In contrast, an attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges based on attributes.

## Assessment Objectives
privileged user accounts are established and administered in accordance with a role-based access scheme; privileged role or attribute assignments are monitored; changes to roles or attributes are monitored; access is revoked when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer appropriate.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing account management  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system-generated list of privileged user accounts and associated roles  records of actions taken when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate  system audit records  audit tracking and monitoring reports  system monitoring records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with account management responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing account management functions  mechanisms monitoring privileged role assignments
