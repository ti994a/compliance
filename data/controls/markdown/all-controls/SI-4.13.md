## Control Statement
Analyze communications traffic and event patterns for the system; Develop profiles representing common traffic and event patterns; and Use the traffic and event profiles in tuning system-monitoring devices.

## Implementation Guidance
Identifying and understanding common communications traffic and event patterns help organizations provide useful information to system monitoring devices to more effectively identify suspicious or anomalous traffic and events when they occur. Such information can help reduce the number of false positives and false negatives during system monitoring.

## Assessment Objectives
communications traffic for the system is analyzed; event patterns for the system are analyzed; profiles representing common traffic are developed; profiles representing event patterns are developed; traffic profiles are used in tuning system-monitoring devices; event profiles are used in tuning system-monitoring devices.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques  system design documentation  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of profiles representing common traffic patterns and/or events  system protocols documentation  list of acceptable thresholds for false positives and false negatives  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system  organizational personnel responsible for the intrusion detection system Organizational processes for intrusion detection and system monitoring  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion detection and system monitoring capabilities  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the analysis of communications traffic and event patterns
