## Control Statement
Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.

## Implementation Guidance
Privileged functions include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security or privacy controls, establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks, and administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users include circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms. Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions is enforced by [AC-3](#ac-3).

## Assessment Objectives
non-privileged users are prevented from executing privileged functions.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing least privilege  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of privileged functions and associated user account assignments  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing least privilege functions for non-privileged users
