## Control Statement
protect against the effects of the following types of denial-of-service events: types of denial-of-service events protected against or limited are defined; ; and Employ the following controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective: controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective by type of denial-of-service event are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Denial-of-service events may occur due to a variety of internal and external causes, such as an attack by an adversary or a lack of planning to support organizational needs with respect to capacity and bandwidth. Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the origination and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of denial-of-service attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to denial-of-service events.

## Assessment Objectives
the effects of types of denial-of-service events protected against or limited are defined; are protect against; controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective by type of denial-of-service event are defined; are employed to achieve the denial-of-service protection objective.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing denial-of-service protection  system design documentation  list of denial-of-service attacks requiring employment of security safeguards to protect against or limit effects of such attacks  list of security safeguards protecting against or limiting the effects of denial-of-service attacks  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with incident response responsibilities  system developer Mechanisms protecting against or limiting the effects of denial-of-service attacks
