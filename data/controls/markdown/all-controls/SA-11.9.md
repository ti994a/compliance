## Control Statement
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ interactive application security testing tools to identify flaws and document the results.

## Implementation Guidance
Interactive (also known as instrumentation-based) application security testing is a method of detecting vulnerabilities by observing applications as they run during testing. The use of instrumentation relies on direct measurements of the actual running applications and uses access to the code, user interaction, libraries, frameworks, backend connections, and configurations to directly measure control effectiveness. When combined with analysis techniques, interactive application security testing can identify a broad range of potential vulnerabilities and confirm control effectiveness. Instrumentation-based testing works in real time and can be used continuously throughout the system development life cycle.

## Assessment Objectives
the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to employ interactive application security testing tools to identify flaws; the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to document the results of flaw identification.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing system developer security testing  procedures addressing interactive application security testing  solicitation documentation  acquisition documentation  service level agreements  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service  system developer security test and evaluation plans  security test and evaluation results  security flaw and remediation tracking reports  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with developer security testing responsibilities  organizational personnel with configuration management responsibilities  system developers Organizational processes for interactive application security testing  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing interactive application security testing
