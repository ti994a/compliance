## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of least common mechanism in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of least common mechanism are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of least common mechanism states that the amount of mechanism common to more than one user and depended on by all users is minimized [POPEK74](#79453f84-26a4-4995-8257-d32d37aefea3) . Mechanism minimization implies that different components of a system refrain from using the same mechanism to access a system resource. Every shared mechanism (especially a mechanism involving shared variables) represents a potential information path between users and is designed with care to ensure that it does not unintentionally compromise security [SALTZER75](#c9495d6e-ef64-4090-8509-e58c3b9009ff) . Implementing the principle of least common mechanism helps to reduce the adverse consequences of sharing the system state among different programs. A single program that corrupts a shared state (including shared variables) has the potential to corrupt other programs that are dependent on the state. The principle of least common mechanism also supports the principle of simplicity of design and addresses the issue of covert storage channels [LAMPSON73](#d1cdab13-4218-400d-91a9-c3818dfa5ec8).

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of least common mechanism are defined; implement the security design principle of least common mechanism.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing the security design principle of least common mechanism used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of least common mechanism in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of least common mechanism in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification
