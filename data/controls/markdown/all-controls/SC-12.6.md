## Control Statement
Maintain physical control of cryptographic keys when stored information is encrypted by external service providers.

## Implementation Guidance
For organizations that use external service providers (e.g., cloud service or data center providers), physical control of cryptographic keys provides additional assurance that information stored by such external providers is not subject to unauthorized disclosure or modification.

## Assessment Objectives
physical control of cryptographic keys is maintained when stored information is encrypted by external service providers.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing cryptographic key establishment, management, and recovery  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with responsibilities for cryptographic key establishment or management Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing cryptographic key establishment and management
