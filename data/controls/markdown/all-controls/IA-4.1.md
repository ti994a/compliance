## Control Statement
Prohibit the use of system account identifiers that are the same as public identifiers for individual accounts.

## Implementation Guidance
Prohibiting account identifiers as public identifiers applies to any publicly disclosed account identifier used for communication such as, electronic mail and instant messaging. Prohibiting the use of systems account identifiers that are the same as some public identifier, such as the individual identifier section of an electronic mail address, makes it more difficult for adversaries to guess user identifiers. Prohibiting account identifiers as public identifiers without the implementation of other supporting controls only complicates guessing of identifiers. Additional protections are required for authenticators and credentials to protect the account.

## Assessment Objectives
the use of system account identifiers that are the same as public identifiers is prohibited for individual accounts.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing identifier management  procedures addressing account management  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with identifier management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identifier management
