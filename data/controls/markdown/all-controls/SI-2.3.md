## Control Statement
Measure the time between flaw identification and flaw remediation; and Establish the following benchmarks for taking corrective actions: the benchmarks for taking corrective actions are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations determine the time it takes on average to correct system flaws after such flaws have been identified and subsequently establish organizational benchmarks (i.e., time frames) for taking corrective actions. Benchmarks can be established by the type of flaw or the severity of the potential vulnerability if the flaw can be exploited.

## Assessment Objectives
the time between flaw identification and flaw remediation is measured; the benchmarks for taking corrective actions are defined; for taking corrective actions have been established.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing flaw remediation  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of benchmarks for taking corrective action on identified flaws  records that provide timestamps of flaw identification and subsequent flaw remediation activities  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel responsible for flaw remediation Organizational processes for identifying, reporting, and correcting system flaws  mechanisms used to measure the time between flaw identification and flaw remediation
