## Control Statement
Store backup copies of critical system software and other security-related information backups stored in a separate facility are defined; in a separate facility or in a fire rated container that is not collocated with the operational system.

## Implementation Guidance
Separate storage for critical information applies to all critical information regardless of the type of backup storage media. Critical system software includes operating systems, middleware, cryptographic key management systems, and intrusion detection systems. Security-related information includes inventories of system hardware, software, and firmware components. Alternate storage sites, including geographically distributed architectures, serve as separate storage facilities for organizations. Organizations may provide separate storage by implementing automated backup processes at alternative storage sites (e.g., data centers). The General Services Administration (GSA) establishes standards and specifications for security and fire rated containers.

## Assessment Objectives
backup copies of critical system software and other security-related information backups stored in a separate facility are defined; are stored in a separate facility or in a fire rated container that is not collocated with the operational system.

## Assessment Methods
Contingency planning policy  procedures addressing system backup  contingency plan  backup storage location(s)  system backup configurations and associated documentation  system backup logs or records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with contingency planning and plan implementation responsibilities  organizational personnel with system backup responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities
