## Control Statement
Verify the correct operation of organization-defined security and privacy functions; Perform the verification of the functions specified in SI-6a {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.04 }} ; Alert personnel or roles alerted of failed security and privacy verification tests to failed security and privacy verification tests; and shut the system down when anomalies are discovered.

## Implementation Guidance
Transitional states for systems include system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort. System notifications include hardware indicator lights, electronic alerts to system administrators, and messages to local computer consoles. In contrast to security function verification, privacy function verification ensures that privacy functions operate as expected and are approved by the senior agency official for privacy or that privacy attributes are applied or used as expected.

## Assessment Objectives
security functions verified for correct operation are defined; are verified to be operating correctly; privacy functions verified for correct operation are defined; are verified to be operating correctly; security functions verified for correct operation are defined; are verified {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.04 }} ; privacy functions verified for correct operation are defined; are verified {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.04 }} ; personnel or roles alerted of failed security and privacy verification tests is/are alerted to failed security verification tests; personnel or roles alerted of failed security and privacy verification tests is/are alerted to failed privacy verification tests; shut the system down is/are initiated when anomalies are discovered.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing security and privacy function verification  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  alerts/notifications of failed security verification tests  list of system transition states requiring security functionality verification  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with security and privacy function verification responsibilities  organizational personnel implementing, operating, and maintaining the system  system/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system developer Organizational processes for security and privacy function verification  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the security and privacy function verification capability
