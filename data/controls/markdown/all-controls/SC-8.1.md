## Control Statement
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information during transmission.

## Implementation Guidance
Encryption protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification during transmission. Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the confidentiality and integrity of information during transmission include TLS and IPSec. Cryptographic mechanisms used to protect information integrity include cryptographic hash functions that have applications in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information during transmission.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing transmission confidentiality and integrity  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Cryptographic mechanisms supporting and/or implementing transmission confidentiality and/or integrity  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing alternative physical safeguards  organizational processes for defining and implementing alternative physical safeguards
