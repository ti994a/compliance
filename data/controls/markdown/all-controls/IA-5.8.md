## Control Statement
Implement security controls implemented to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems are defined; to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems.

## Implementation Guidance
When individuals have accounts on multiple systems and use the same authenticators such as passwords, there is the risk that a compromise of one account may lead to the compromise of other accounts. Alternative approaches include having different authenticators (passwords) on all systems, employing a single sign-on or federation mechanism, or using some form of one-time passwords on all systems. Organizations can also use rules of behavior (see [PL-4](#pl-4) ) and access agreements (see [PS-6](#ps-6) ) to mitigate the risk of multiple system accounts.

## Assessment Objectives
security controls implemented to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems are defined; are implemented to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  procedures addressing authenticator management  system security plan  list of individuals having accounts on multiple systems  list of security safeguards intended to manage risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with authenticator management responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing safeguards for authenticator management
