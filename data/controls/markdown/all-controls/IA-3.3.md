## Control Statement
Where addresses are allocated dynamically, standardize dynamic address allocation lease information and the lease duration assigned to devices in accordance with organization-defined lease information and lease duration ; and Audit lease information when assigned to a device.

## Implementation Guidance
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an example of a means by which clients can dynamically receive network address assignments.

## Assessment Objectives
dynamic address allocation lease information assigned to devices where addresses are allocated dynamically are standardized in accordance with lease information employed to standardize dynamic address allocation for devices is defined;; dynamic address allocation lease duration assigned to devices where addresses are allocated dynamically are standardized in accordance with lease duration employed to standardize dynamic address allocation for devices is defined;; lease information is audited when assigned to a device.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing device identification and authentication  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  evidence of lease information and lease duration assigned to devices  device connection reports  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with operational responsibilities for device identification and authentication  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing device identification and authentication capabilities  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing dynamic address allocation  mechanisms supporting and/or implanting auditing of lease information
