## Control Statement
Change security and privacy attributes associated with information only via regrading mechanisms validated using organization-defined techniques or procedures.

## Implementation Guidance
A regrading mechanism is a trusted process authorized to re-classify and re-label data in accordance with a defined policy exception. Validated regrading mechanisms are used by organizations to provide the requisite levels of assurance for attribute reassignment activities. The validation is facilitated by ensuring that regrading mechanisms are single purpose and of limited function. Since security and privacy attribute changes can directly affect policy enforcement actions, implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms is necessary to help ensure that such mechanisms perform in a consistent and correct mode of operation.

## Assessment Objectives
security attributes associated with information are changed only via regrading mechanisms validated using techniques or procedures used to validate regrading mechanisms for security attributes are defined;; privacy attributes associated with information are changed only via regrading mechanisms validated using techniques or procedures used to validate regrading mechanisms for privacy attributes are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing reassignment of security attributes to information  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for reassigning association of security and privacy attributes to information  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing techniques or procedures for reassigning association of security and privacy attributes to information
