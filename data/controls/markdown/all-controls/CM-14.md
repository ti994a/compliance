## Control Statement
Prevent the installation of organization-defined software and firmware components without verification that the component has been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.

## Implementation Guidance
Software and firmware components prevented from installation unless signed with recognized and approved certificates include software and firmware version updates, patches, service packs, device drivers, and basic input/output system updates. Organizations can identify applicable software and firmware components by type, by specific items, or a combination of both. Digital signatures and organizational verification of such signatures is a method of code authentication.

## Assessment Objectives
the installation of software components requiring verification of a digitally signed certificate before installation are defined; is prevented unless it is verified that the software has been digitally signed using a certificate recognized and approved by the organization; the installation of firmware components requiring verification of a digitally signed certificate before installation are defined; is prevented unless it is verified that the firmware has been digitally signed using a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing digitally signed certificates for software and firmware components  configuration management plan  system security plan  system design documentation  change control records  system component inventory  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for verifying digitally signed certificates for software and firmware component installation  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developers Organizational processes governing information location  mechanisms enforcing policies and methods for governing information location  automated tools supporting or implementing digitally signatures for software and firmware components  automated tools supporting or implementing verification of digital signatures for software and firmware component installation
