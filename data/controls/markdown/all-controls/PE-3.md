## Control Statement
Enforce physical access authorizations at entry and exit points to the facility in which the system resides are defined; by: Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility; and Controlling ingress and egress to the facility using {{ insert: param, pe-03_odp.03 }} ; Maintain physical access audit logs for entry or exit points for which physical access logs are maintained are defined;; Control access to areas within the facility designated as publicly accessible by implementing the following controls: physical access controls to control access to areas within the facility designated as publicly accessible are defined;; Escort visitors and control visitor activity circumstances requiring visitor escorts and control of visitor activity are defined;; Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices; Inventory physical access devices inventoried are defined; every frequency at which to inventory physical access devices is defined; ; and Change combinations and keys organization-defined frequency and/or when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or when individuals possessing the keys or combinations are transferred or terminated.

## Implementation Guidance
Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals with permanent physical access authorizations are not considered visitors. Physical access controls for publicly accessible areas may include physical access control logs/records, guards, or physical access devices and barriers to prevent movement from publicly accessible areas to non-public areas. Organizations determine the types of guards needed, including professional security staff, system users, or administrative staff. Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, biometric readers, and card readers. Physical access control systems comply with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural, automated, or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems that require supplemental access controls, or both. Components of systems may be in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations controlling access to the components.

## Assessment Objectives
physical access authorizations are enforced at entry and exit points to the facility in which the system resides are defined; by verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility; physical access authorizations are enforced at entry and exit points to the facility in which the system resides are defined; by controlling ingress and egress to the facility using {{ insert: param, pe-03_odp.03 }} ; physical access audit logs are maintained for entry or exit points for which physical access logs are maintained are defined;; access to areas within the facility designated as publicly accessible are maintained by implementing physical access controls to control access to areas within the facility designated as publicly accessible are defined;; visitors are escorted; visitor activity is controlled circumstances requiring visitor escorts and control of visitor activity are defined;; keys are secured; combinations are secured; other physical access devices are secured; physical access devices inventoried are defined; are inventoried frequency at which to inventory physical access devices is defined;; combinations are changed frequency at which to change combinations is defined; , when combinations are compromised, or when individuals possessing the combinations are transferred or terminated; keys are changed frequency at which to change keys is defined; , when keys are lost, or when individuals possessing the keys are transferred or terminated.

## Assessment Methods
Physical and environmental protection policy  procedures addressing physical access control  physical access control logs or records  inventory records of physical access control devices  system entry and exit points  records of key and lock combination changes  storage locations for physical access control devices  physical access control devices  list of security safeguards controlling access to designated publicly accessible areas within facility  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with physical access control responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Organizational processes for physical access control  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical access control  physical access control devices
