## Control Statement
Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system.

## Implementation Guidance
Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems or the operational procedures related to the system can potentially have significant effects on the security of the systems or individuals’ privacy. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes. Access restrictions include physical and logical access controls (see [AC-3](#ac-3) and [PE-3](#pe-3) ), software libraries, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (i.e., changes implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and change windows (i.e., changes occur only during specified times).

## Assessment Objectives
physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are defined and documented; physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are approved; physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are enforced; logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are defined and documented; logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are approved; logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are enforced.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing access restrictions for changes to the system  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system architecture and configuration documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  logical access approvals  physical access approvals  access credentials  change control records  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with logical access control responsibilities  organizational personnel with physical access control responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for managing access restrictions to change  mechanisms supporting, implementing, or enforcing access restrictions associated with changes to the system
