## Control Statement
Implement the security design principle of acceptable security in systems or system components that implement the security design principle of acceptable security are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The principle of acceptable security requires that the level of privacy and performance that the system provides is consistent with the users’ expectations. The perception of personal privacy may affect user behavior, morale, and effectiveness. Based on the organizational privacy policy and the system design, users should be able to restrict their actions to protect their privacy. When systems fail to provide intuitive interfaces or meet privacy and performance expectations, users may either choose to completely avoid the system or use it in ways that may be inefficient or even insecure.

## Assessment Objectives
systems or system components that implement the security design principle of acceptable security are defined; implement the security design principle of acceptable security.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  system and services acquisition procedures  procedures addressing the security design principle of acceptable security used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system  system design documentation  security and privacy requirements and specifications for the system  system security and privacy architecture  personally identifiable information processing policy  privacy notifications provided to users  system security plan  privacy plan  privacy impact assessment  privacy risk assessment documentation  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  organizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities  system developers Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of acceptable security in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of acceptable security in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification  mechanisms that enforce security policies
