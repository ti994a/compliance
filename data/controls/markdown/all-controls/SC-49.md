## Control Statement
Implement hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement mechanisms between security domains requiring hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement mechanisms are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
System owners may require additional strength of mechanism and robustness to ensure domain separation and policy enforcement for specific types of threats and environments of operation. Hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement provide greater strength of mechanism than software-enforced separation and policy enforcement.

## Assessment Objectives
hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement mechanisms are implemented between security domains requiring hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement mechanisms are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing cross-domain policy enforcement  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing hardware-enforced security domain separation and policy enforcement
