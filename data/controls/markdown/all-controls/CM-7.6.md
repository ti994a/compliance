## Control Statement
Require that the following user-installed software execute in a confined physical or virtual machine environment with limited privileges: user-installed software required executed in a confined environment is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Organizations identify software that may be of concern regarding its origin or potential for containing malicious code. For this type of software, user installations occur in confined environments of operation to limit or contain damage from malicious code that may be executed.

## Assessment Objectives
user-installed software required executed in a confined environment is defined; is required to be executed in a confined physical or virtual machine environment with limited privileges.

## Assessment Methods
Configuration management policy  procedures addressing least functionality in the system  configuration management plan  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list or record of software required to execute in a confined environment  system component inventory  common secure configuration checklists  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for identifying and/or managing user-installed software and associated privileges  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational process for identifying user-installed software required to execute in a confined environment  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the confinement of user-installed software to physical or virtual machine environments  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing privilege limitations on user-installed software
