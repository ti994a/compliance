Specific information includes boot firmware for certain types of machines. The automatic implementation of controls within organizational systems includes reversing the changes, halting the system, or triggering audit alerts when unauthorized modifications to critical security files occur.

## Assessment Objectives
shut down the system are automatically performed when integrity violations are discovered.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing software, firmware, and information integrity  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  integrity verification tools and associated documentation  records of integrity scans  records of integrity checks and responses to integrity violations  audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for software, firmware, and/or information integrity  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Software, firmware, and information integrity verification tools  mechanisms providing an automated response to integrity violations  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing security safeguards to be implemented when integrity violations are discovered
