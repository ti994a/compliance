## Control Statement
Implement spam protection mechanisms with a learning capability to more effectively identify legitimate communications traffic.

## Implementation Guidance
Learning mechanisms include Bayesian filters that respond to user inputs that identify specific traffic as spam or legitimate by updating algorithm parameters and thereby more accurately separating types of traffic.

## Assessment Objectives
spam protection mechanisms with a learning capability are implemented to more effectively identify legitimate communications traffic.

## Assessment Methods
System and information integrity policy  system and information integrity procedures  procedures addressing spam protection  spam protection mechanisms  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel responsible for spam protection  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators  system developer Organizational processes for spam protection  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing spam protection mechanisms with a learning capability
