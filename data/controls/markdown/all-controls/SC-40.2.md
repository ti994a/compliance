## Control Statement
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to reduce the detection potential of wireless links to the level of reduction achieved to reduce the detection potential of wireless links is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The implementation of cryptographic mechanisms to reduce detection potential is used for covert communications and to protect wireless transmitters from geo-location. It also ensures that the spread spectrum waveforms used to achieve a low probability of detection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. Mission requirements, projected threats, concept of operations, and applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, and standards determine the levels to which wireless links are undetectable.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms to reduce the detection potential of wireless links to the level of reduction achieved to reduce the detection potential of wireless links is defined; are implemented.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  access control policy and procedures  procedures addressing wireless link protection  system design documentation  wireless network diagrams  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  system communications hardware and software  security categorization results  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel authorizing, installing, configuring, and/or maintaining internal and external wireless links Cryptographic mechanisms enforcing protections to reduce the detection of wireless links
