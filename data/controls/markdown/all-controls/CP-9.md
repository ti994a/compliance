## Control Statement
Conduct backups of user-level information contained in system components for which to conduct backups of user-level information is defined; frequency at which to conduct backups of user-level information consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives is defined;; Conduct backups of system-level information contained in the system frequency at which to conduct backups of system-level information consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives is defined;; Conduct backups of system documentation, including security- and privacy-related documentation frequency at which to conduct backups of system documentation consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives is defined; ; and Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup information.

## Implementation Guidance
System-level information includes system state information, operating system software, middleware, application software, and licenses. User-level information includes information other than system-level information. Mechanisms employed to protect the integrity of system backups include digital signatures and cryptographic hashes. Protection of system backup information while in transit is addressed by [MP-5](#mp-5) and [SC-8](#sc-8) . System backups reflect the requirements in contingency plans as well as other organizational requirements for backing up information. Organizations may be subject to laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies with requirements regarding specific categories of information (e.g., personal health information). Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel regarding such requirements.

## Assessment Objectives
backups of user-level information contained in system components for which to conduct backups of user-level information is defined; are conducted frequency at which to conduct backups of user-level information consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives is defined;; backups of system-level information contained in the system are conducted frequency at which to conduct backups of system-level information consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives is defined;; backups of system documentation, including security- and privacy-related documentation are conducted frequency at which to conduct backups of system documentation consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives is defined;; the confidentiality of backup information is protected; the integrity of backup information is protected; the availability of backup information is protected.

## Assessment Methods
Contingency planning policy  procedures addressing system backup  contingency plan  backup storage location(s)  system backup logs or records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system backup responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Organizational processes for conducting system backups  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system backups
