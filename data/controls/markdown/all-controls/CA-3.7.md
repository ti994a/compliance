## Control Statement
Identify transitive (downstream) information exchanges with other systems through the systems identified in [CA-3a](#ca-3_smt.a) ; and Take measures to ensure that transitive (downstream) information exchanges cease when the controls on identified transitive (downstream) systems cannot be verified or validated.

## Implementation Guidance
Transitive or "downstream" information exchanges are information exchanges between the system or systems with which the organizational system exchanges information and other systems. For mission-essential systems, services, and applications, including high value assets, it is necessary to identify such information exchanges. The transparency of the controls or protection measures in place in such downstream systems connected directly or indirectly to organizational systems is essential to understanding the security and privacy risks resulting from those information exchanges. Organizational systems can inherit risk from downstream systems through transitive connections and information exchanges, which can make the organizational systems more susceptible to threats, hazards, and adverse impacts.

## Assessment Objectives
transitive (downstream) information exchanges with other systems through the systems identified in CA-03a are identified; measures are taken to ensure that transitive (downstream) information exchanges cease when the controls on identified transitive (downstream) systems cannot be verified or validated.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing system connections  system and communications protection policy  system interconnection agreements  information exchange security agreements  memoranda of understanding or agreements  service level agreements  non-disclosure agreements  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  control assessment report  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing connections to external systems  network administrators  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Mechanisms implementing restrictions on external system connections
