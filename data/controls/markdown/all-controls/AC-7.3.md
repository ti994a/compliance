## Control Statement
Limit the number of unsuccessful biometric logon attempts to the number of unsuccessful biometric logon attempts is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Biometrics are probabilistic in nature. The ability to successfully authenticate can be impacted by many factors, including matching performance and presentation attack detection mechanisms. Organizations select the appropriate number of attempts for users based on organizationally-defined factors.

## Assessment Objectives
unsuccessful biometric logon attempts are limited to the number of unsuccessful biometric logon attempts is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing unsuccessful logon attempts on biometric devices  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms implementing access control policy for unsuccessful logon attempts
