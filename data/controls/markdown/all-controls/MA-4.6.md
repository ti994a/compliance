## Control Statement
Implement the following cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity and confidentiality of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications: cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect the integrity and confidentiality of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Failure to protect nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications can result in unauthorized individuals gaining access to organizational information. Unauthorized access during remote maintenance sessions can result in a variety of hostile actions, including malicious code insertion, unauthorized changes to system parameters, and exfiltration of organizational information. Such actions can result in the loss or degradation of mission or business capabilities.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect the integrity and confidentiality of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications are defined; are implemented to protect the integrity of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications; cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect the integrity and confidentiality of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications are defined; are implemented to protect the confidentiality of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications.

## Assessment Methods
Maintenance policy  procedures addressing nonlocal system maintenance  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  cryptographic mechanisms protecting nonlocal maintenance activities  maintenance records  diagnostic records  audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system maintenance responsibilities  network engineers  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Cryptographic mechanisms protecting nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications
