## Control Statement
Handle device identification and authentication based on attestation by configuration management process employed to handle device identification and authentication based on attestation is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Device attestation refers to the identification and authentication of a device based on its configuration and known operating state. Device attestation can be determined via a cryptographic hash of the device. If device attestation is the means of identification and authentication, then it is important that patches and updates to the device are handled via a configuration management process such that the patches and updates are done securely and do not disrupt identification and authentication to other devices.

## Assessment Objectives
device identification and authentication are handled based on attestation by configuration management process employed to handle device identification and authentication based on attestation is defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Identification and authentication policy  system security plan  procedures addressing device identification and authentication  procedures addressing device configuration management  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  configuration management records  change control records  system audit records  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with operational responsibilities for device identification and authentication  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing device identification and authentication capabilities  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing configuration management  cryptographic mechanisms supporting device attestation
