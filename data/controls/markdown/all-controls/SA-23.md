## Control Statement
Employ design modification on systems or system components supporting mission-essential services or functions are defined; supporting mission essential services or functions to increase the trustworthiness in those systems or components.

## Implementation Guidance
It is often necessary for a system or system component that supports mission-essential services or functions to be enhanced to maximize the trustworthiness of the resource. Sometimes this enhancement is done at the design level. In other instances, it is done post-design, either through modifications of the system in question or by augmenting the system with additional components. For example, supplemental authentication or non-repudiation functions may be added to the system to enhance the identity of critical resources to other resources that depend on the organization-defined resources.

## Assessment Objectives
design modification is employed on systems or system components supporting mission-essential services or functions are defined; supporting essential services or functions to increase the trustworthiness in those systems or components.

## Assessment Methods
System and services acquisition policy  procedures addressing design modification, augmentation, or reconfiguration of systems or system components  documented evidence of design modification, augmentation, or reconfiguration  system security plan  supply chain risk management plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  organizational personnel with the responsibility for security architecture  organizational personnel responsible for configuration management Organizational processes for the modification of design, augmentation, or reconfiguration of systems or system components  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing design modification, augmentation, or reconfiguration of systems or system components
