## Control Statement
Provide the capability to dynamically isolate system components dynamically isolated from other system components are defined; from other system components.

## Implementation Guidance
The capability to dynamically isolate certain internal system components is useful when it is necessary to partition or separate system components of questionable origin from components that possess greater trustworthiness. Component isolation reduces the attack surface of organizational systems. Isolating selected system components can also limit the damage from successful attacks when such attacks occur.

## Assessment Objectives
the capability to dynamically isolate system components dynamically isolated from other system components are defined; from other system components is provided.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing boundary protection  system design documentation  system hardware and software  system architecture  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of system components to be dynamically isolated/segregated from other components of the system  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the capability to dynamically isolate/segregate system components
