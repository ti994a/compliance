## Control Statement
Document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance of the following systems, system components, and associated data: systems, system components, and associated data that require valid provenance are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
Every system and system component has a point of origin and may be changed throughout its existence. Provenance is the chronology of the origin, development, ownership, location, and changes to a system or system component and associated data. It may also include personnel and processes used to interact with or make modifications to the system, component, or associated data. Organizations consider developing procedures (see [SR-1](#sr-1) ) for allocating responsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance for systems and system components; transferring provenance documentation and responsibility between organizations; and preventing and monitoring for unauthorized changes to the provenance records. Organizations have methods to document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance baselines for systems, system components, and related data. These actions help track, assess, and document any changes to the provenance, including changes in supply chain elements or configuration, and help ensure non-repudiation of provenance information and the provenance change records. Provenance considerations are addressed throughout the system development life cycle and incorporated into contracts and other arrangements, as appropriate.

## Assessment Objectives
valid provenance is documented for systems, system components, and associated data that require valid provenance are defined;; valid provenance is monitored for systems, system components, and associated data that require valid provenance are defined;; valid provenance is maintained for systems, system components, and associated data that require valid provenance are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Supply chain risk management policy  supply chain risk management procedures  supply chain risk management plan  documentation of critical systems, critical system components, and associated data  documentation showing the history of ownership, custody, and location of and changes to critical systems or critical system components  system architecture  inter-organizational agreements and procedures  contracts  system security plan  privacy plan  personally identifiable information processing policy  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with acquisition responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities Organizational processes for identifying the provenance of critical systems and critical system components  mechanisms used to document, monitor, or maintain provenance
