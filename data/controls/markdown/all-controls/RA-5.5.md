## Control Statement
Implement privileged access authorization to system components to which privileged access is authorized for selected vulnerability scanning activities are defined; for vulnerability scanning activities selected for privileged access authorization to system components are defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive, or the system component that is the subject of the scanning may contain classified or controlled unclassified information, such as personally identifiable information. Privileged access authorization to selected system components facilitates more thorough vulnerability scanning and protects the sensitive nature of such scanning.

## Assessment Objectives
privileged access authorization is implemented to system components to which privileged access is authorized for selected vulnerability scanning activities are defined; for vulnerability scanning activities selected for privileged access authorization to system components are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Risk assessment policy  procedures addressing vulnerability scanning  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of system components for vulnerability scanning  personnel access authorization list  authorization credentials  access authorization records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning responsibilities  system/network administrators  organizational personnel responsible for access control to the system  organizational personnel responsible for configuration management of the system  system developers  organizational personnel with security responsibilities Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning  organizational processes for access control  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access control  mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing vulnerability scanning
