## Control Statement
Restrict access to organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital media to organization-defined personnel or roles.

## Implementation Guidance
System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes flash drives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state, magnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Denying access to patient medical records in a community hospital unless the individuals seeking access to such records are authorized healthcare providers is an example of restricting access to non-digital media. Limiting access to the design specifications stored on compact discs in the media library to individuals on the system development team is an example of restricting access to digital media.

## Assessment Objectives
access to types of digital media to which access is restricted are defined; is restricted to personnel or roles authorized to access digital media; access to types of non-digital media to which access is restricted are defined; is restricted to personnel or roles authorized to access non-digital media.

## Assessment Methods
System media protection policy  procedures addressing media access restrictions  access control policy and procedures  physical and environmental protection policy and procedures  media storage facilities  access control records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with system media protection responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Organizational processes for restricting information media  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media access restrictions
