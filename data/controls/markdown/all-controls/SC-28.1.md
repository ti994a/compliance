## Control Statement
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the following information at rest on system components or media requiring cryptographic protection: information requiring cryptographic protection is defined;.

## Implementation Guidance
The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to encrypt information on system components or media or encrypt data structures, including files, records, or fields.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information requiring cryptographic protection is defined; at rest on system components or media requiring cryptographic protection; cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized modification of information requiring cryptographic protection is defined; at rest on system components or media requiring cryptographic protection.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing the protection of information at rest  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  cryptographic mechanisms and associated configuration documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Cryptographic mechanisms implementing confidentiality and integrity protections for information at rest
