## Control Statement
Uniquely identify and authenticate source and destination points by organization, system, application, service, individual for information transfer.

## Implementation Guidance
Attribution is a critical component of a security and privacy concept of operations. The ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing within systems allows the forensic reconstruction of events and encourages policy compliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations or individuals. Successful domain authentication requires that system labels distinguish among systems, organizations, and individuals involved in preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating information. Attribution also allows organizations to better maintain the lineage of personally identifiable information processing as it flows through systems and can facilitate consent tracking, as well as correction, deletion, or access requests from individuals.

## Assessment Objectives
source and destination points are uniquely identified and authenticated by organization, system, application, service, individual for information transfer.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  information flow control policies  procedures addressing information flow enforcement  procedures addressing source and destination domain identification and authentication  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  list of system labels  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy
