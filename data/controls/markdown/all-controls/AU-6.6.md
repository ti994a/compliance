## Control Statement
Correlate information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.

## Implementation Guidance
The correlation of physical audit record information and the audit records from systems may assist organizations in identifying suspicious behavior or supporting evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individual’s identity for logical access to certain systems with the additional physical security information that the individual was present at the facility when the logical access occurred may be useful in investigations.

## Assessment Objectives
information from audit records is correlated with information obtained from monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.

## Assessment Methods
Audit and accountability policy  procedures addressing audit review, analysis, and reporting  procedures addressing physical access monitoring  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  documentation providing evidence of correlated information obtained from audit records and physical access monitoring records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis, and reporting responsibilities  organizational personnel with physical access monitoring responsibilities  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities Mechanisms implementing the capability to correlate information from audit records with information from monitoring physical access
