## Control Statement
Provide the capability to associate organization-defined security and privacy attributes with organization-defined subjects and objects by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals).

## Implementation Guidance
Systems, in general, provide the capability for privileged users to assign security and privacy attributes to system-defined subjects (e.g., users) and objects (e.g., directories, files, and ports). Some systems provide additional capability for general users to assign security and privacy attributes to additional objects (e.g., files, emails). The association of attributes by authorized individuals is described in the design documentation. The support provided by systems can include prompting users to select security and privacy attributes to be associated with information objects, employing automated mechanisms to categorize information with attributes based on defined policies, or ensuring that the combination of the security or privacy attributes selected is valid. Organizations consider the creation, deletion, or modification of attributes when defining auditable events.

## Assessment Objectives
authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are provided with the capability to associate security attributes associated with subjects by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are defined; with subjects requiring the association of security attributes by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are defined;; authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are provided with the capability to associate security attributes associated with objects by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are defined; with objects requiring the association of security attributes by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are defined;; authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are provided with the capability to associate privacy attributes associated with subjects by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are defined; with subjects requiring the association of privacy attributes by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are defined;; authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are provided with the capability to associate privacy attributes associated with objects by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are defined; with objects requiring the association of privacy attributes by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) are defined;.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing the association of security and privacy attributes to information  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  list of users authorized to associate security and privacy attributes to information  system prompts for privileged users to select security and privacy attributes to be associated with information objects  system audit records  system security plan  privacy plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for associating security and privacy attributes to information  organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities  system developers Mechanisms supporting user associations of security and privacy attributes to information
