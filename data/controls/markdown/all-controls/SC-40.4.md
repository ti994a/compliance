## Control Statement
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the identification of wireless transmitters for which cryptographic mechanisms are implemented are defined; by using the transmitter signal parameters.

## Implementation Guidance
The implementation of cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the identification of wireless transmitters protects against the unique identification of wireless transmitters for the purposes of intelligence exploitation by ensuring that anti-fingerprinting alterations to signal parameters are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. It also provides anonymity when required. Radio fingerprinting techniques identify the unique signal parameters of transmitters to fingerprint such transmitters for purposes of tracking and mission or user identification.

## Assessment Objectives
cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent the identification of wireless transmitters for which cryptographic mechanisms are implemented are defined; by using the transmitter signal parameters.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  access control policy and procedures  procedures addressing system design documentation  wireless network diagrams  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system architecture  system communications hardware and software  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system  organizational personnel authorizing, installing, configuring, and/or maintaining internal and external wireless links Cryptographic mechanisms preventing the identification of wireless transmitters
