## Control Statement
Restrict privileged accounts on the system to personnel or roles to which privileged accounts on the system are restricted.

## Implementation Guidance
Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from accessing privileged information or privileged functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of restricting privileged accounts between allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain accounts provided that they retain the ability to control system configurations for key parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.

## Assessment Objectives
privileged accounts on the system are restricted to personnel or roles to which privileged accounts on the system are restricted.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing least privilege  list of system-generated privileged accounts  list of system administration personnel  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system/network administrators Mechanisms implementing least privilege functions
