## Control Statement
Disable, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities embedded within system components prior to issuance and deployment.

## Implementation Guidance
Wireless networking capabilities that are embedded within system components represent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. Disabling wireless capabilities when not needed for essential organizational missions or functions can reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.

## Assessment Objectives
when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities embedded within system components are disabled prior to issuance and deployment.

## Assessment Methods
Access control policy  procedures addressing wireless implementation and usage (including restrictions)  system design documentation  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities Mechanisms managing the disabling of wireless networking capabilities internally embedded within system components
