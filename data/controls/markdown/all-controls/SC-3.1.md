## Control Statement
Employ hardware separation mechanisms to implement security function isolation.

## Implementation Guidance
Hardware separation mechanisms include hardware ring architectures that are implemented within microprocessors and hardware-enforced address segmentation used to support logically distinct storage objects with separate attributes (i.e., readable, writeable).

## Assessment Objectives
hardware separation mechanisms are employed to implement security function isolation.

## Assessment Methods
System and communications protection policy  procedures addressing security function isolation  system design documentation  hardware separation mechanisms  system configuration settings and associated documentation  system audit records  system security plan  other relevant documents or records System/network administrators  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities  system developer Separation of security functions from non-security functions within the system
