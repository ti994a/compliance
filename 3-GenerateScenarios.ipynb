    "# NIST SP 800-53 Controls Processing Pipeline\n",
    "## Step 3: Generate Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Create realistic compliance test scenarios using AWS Bedrock to generate diverse, multi-policy situations that simulate real-world organizational compliance challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: NIST Compliance LLM Evaluation Framework  \n",
    "**Last Updated**: January 2025  \n",
    "**Environment**: SageMaker Studio, Python 3.11\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as the third stage in a four-part pipeline for evaluating LLM performance on NIST compliance scenarios. It generates 1,000 realistic compliance scenarios (500 compliant, 500 non-compliant) that incorporate multiple organizational policies to create complex, real-world evaluation situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective compliance automation requires testing against realistic scenarios that mirror actual organizational situations. This notebook creates random, diverse test scenarios that mix and match employee onboarding, data access requests, security incidents, and other common business processes - based on the NIST control framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organizational policies from S3 (generated by `2-GeneratePolicies.ipynb`)\n",
    "- Structured scenario JSONL files stored in S3 for LLM evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieves organizational policies from S3 storage\n",
    "2. Uses AWS Bedrock to create realistic compliance scenarios\n",
    "3. Enforces JSON schema with scenario details, compliance status, and violation reasons\n",
    "4. Alternates between compliant and non-compliant scenarios for unbiased evaluation\n",
    "5. Stores generated scenarios in S3 for downstream LLM testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each scenario incorporates multiple randomized policies for realistic complexity\n",
    "- Equal distribution of compliant and non-compliant scenarios\n",
    "- JSON schema enforcement ensures consistent data format so that downstream processing can read\n",
    "- Complex, realistic, business-relevant scenarios\n",
    "- Retry logic with exponential backoff for API throttling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configurable Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total Scenarios: 1,000 (200 scenarios × 50 batches)\n",
    "- Scenario Length: ~350 words per scenario\n",
    "- Policy Coverage: 10 policies per scenario\n",
    "- Model Selection: Configurable Bedrock model ARNs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "- `compliance_scenarios.jsonl`: Complete set of labeled scenarios for LLM evaluation\n",
    "                                                                  \n",
    "\n",
    "Structured JSON:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"scenarios\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"scenario-id\": \"scenario-id-1\",\n",
    "      \"scenario-detail\": \"A new employee, Sarah Johnson, joins the IT department... Policies referenced: POL_AC-2, POL_IA-4\",\n",
    "      \"is-compliant\": false,\n",
    "      \"non-compliant-reason\": \"The scenario violates access control policy...\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- AWS Bedrock access with model inference permissions\n",
    "- AWS S3 read/write access to compliance bucket\n",
    "- Python libraries: boto3, json, pathlib, compliance_utils\n",
    "- Organizational policies from previous pipeline step\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses direct policy loading rather than knowledgebase retrieval to ensure 100% accuracy in policy selection and avoid incomplete context retrieval that could affect scenario quality.  (Knowledgebase retrieval was tried.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Generated scenarios feed into `3-JudgeScenarios.ipynb` for LLM performance evaluation."
